abstract: We propose an interpretation of the composition of volatiles observed in
  comets based on their trapping in the form of clathrate hydrates in the solar nebula.
  The formation of clathrates is calculated from the statistical thermodynamics of
  Lunine and Stevenson (1985, Astrophys. J. Suppl. 58, 493-531), and occurs in an
  evolutionary turbulent solar nebula described by the model of Hersant et al. (2001,
  Astrophys. J. 554, 391-407). It is assumed that clathrate hydrates were incorporated
  into the icy grains that formed cometesimals. The strong depletion of the N $_2$
  molecule with respect to CO observed in some comets is explained by the fact that
  CO forms clathrate hydrates much more easily than does N $_2$. The efficiency of
  this depletion, as well as the amount of trapped CO, depends upon the amount of
  water ice available in the region where the clathration took place. This might explain
  the diversity of CO abundances observed in comets. The same theory, applied to the
  trapping of volatiles around 5 AU, explains the enrichments in Ar, Kr, Xe, C, and
  N with respect to the solar abundance measured in the deep troposphere of Jupiter
  (Gautier et al., 2001a,b).
