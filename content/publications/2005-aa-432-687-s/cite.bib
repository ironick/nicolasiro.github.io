 abstract = {Exact axisymmetric analytical solutions of the governing MHD equations
for magnetized and rotating outflows are applied to the solar
wind during solar minimum as observed by ULYSSES. Using the
spacecraft data, the latitudinal dependences of physical
quantities such as the density, velocity, magnetic field and
temperature are analytically described. The self-similar
solutions are then compared to the global structure of the wind
from one solar radius to 5 AU and beyond, including consistently
the rotation of the outflow. The model makes it possible to
describe the initial flaring of the magnetic dipolar structure,
reproducing in a satisfactory way the observed profiles of the
velocity, density and temperature with heliocentric distance.
Finally, this model is in agreement with the conjecture that the
solar wind should not be collimated at large distances, even
close to its rotational axis.},
