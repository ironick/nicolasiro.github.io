abstract: Exact axisymmetric analytical solutions of the governing MHD equations for
  magnetized and rotating outflows are applied to the solar wind during solar minimum
  as observed by ULYSSES. Using the spacecraft data, the latitudinal dependences of
  physical quantities such as the density, velocity, magnetic field and temperature
  are analytically described. The self-similar solutions are then compared to the
  global structure of the wind from one solar radius to 5 AU and beyond, including
  consistently the rotation of the outflow. The model makes it possible to describe
  the initial flaring of the magnetic dipolar structure, reproducing in a satisfactory
  way the observed profiles of the velocity, density and temperature with heliocentric
  distance. Finally, this model is in agreement with the conjecture that the solar
  wind should not be collimated at large distances, even close to its rotational axis.
