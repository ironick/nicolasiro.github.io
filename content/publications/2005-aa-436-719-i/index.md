abstract: We present a time-dependent radiative model of the atmosphere of HD 209458b
  and investigate its thermal structure and chemical composition. In a first step,
  the stellar heating profile and radiative timescales were calculated under planet-averaged
  insolation conditions. We find that 99.99% of the incoming stellar flux has been
  absorbed before reaching the 7 bar level. Stellar photons cannot therefore penetrate
  deeply enough to explain the large radius of the planet. We derive a radiative time
  constant which increases with depth and reaches about 8 h at 0.1 bar and 2.3 days
  at 1 bar. Time-dependent temperature profiles were also calculated, in the limit
  of a zonal wind that is independent of height (i.e. solid-body rotation) and constant
  absorption coefficients. We predict day-night variations of the effective temperature
  of åisebox-0.5ex~600 K, for an equatorial rotation rate of 1 km s$^-1$, in good
  agreement with the predictions by Showmann & Guillot (2002). This rotation rate
  yields day-to-night temperature variations in excess of 600 K above the 0.1-bar
  level. These variations rapidly decrease with depth below the 1-bar level and become
  negligible below the i̊sebox-0.5ex~5-bar level for rotation rates of at least 0.5
  km s$^-1$. At high altitudes (mbar pressures or less), the night temperatures are
  low enough to allow sodium to condense into Na2S. Synthetic transit spectra of the
  visible Na doublet show a much weaker sodium absorption on the morning limb than
  on the evening limb. The calculated dimming of the sodium feature during planetary
  transites agrees with the value reported by Charbonneau et al. (2002).
