 abstract = {Context.Nine extrasolar planets with masses between 110 and 430
M_\ensuremathøplus are known to transit their star. The
knowledge of their masses and radii allows an estimate of their
composition, but uncertainties on equations of state, opacities
and possible missing energy sources imply that only inaccurate
constraints can be derived when considering each planet
separately.\Aims.We seek to better understand the
composition of transiting extrasolar planets by considering them
as an ensemble, and by comparing the obtained planetary
properties to that of the parent stars.\Methods.We
use evolution models and constraints on the stellar ages to
derive the mass of heavy elements present in the planets.
Possible additional energy sources like tidal dissipation due to
an inclined orbit or to downward kinetic energy transport are
considered.\Results.We show that the nine
transiting planets discovered so far belong to a quite
homogeneous ensemble that is characterized by a mass of heavy
elements that is a relatively steep function of the stellar
metallicity, from less than 20 earth masses of heavy elements
around solar composition stars, to up to
åisebox-0.5ex~100 M_\ensuremathøplus for
three times the solar metallicity (the precise values being
model-dependant). The correlation is still to be ascertained
however. Statistical tests imply a worst-case 1/3 probability of
a false positive.\Conclusions.Together with the
observed lack of giant planets in close orbits around metal-poor
stars, these results appear to imply that heavy elements play a
key role in the formation of close-in giant planets. The large
masses of heavy elements inferred for planets orbiting metal
rich stars was not anticipated by planet formation models and
shows the need for alternative theories including migration and
subsequent collection of planetesimals.},
