abstract: Context.Nine extrasolar planets with masses between 110 and 430 M_ensuremathøplus
  are known to transit their star. The knowledge of their masses and radii allows
  an estimate of their composition, but uncertainties on equations of state, opacities
  and possible missing energy sources imply that only inaccurate constraints can be
  derived when considering each planet separately.Aims.We seek to better understand
  the composition of transiting extrasolar planets by considering them as an ensemble,
  and by comparing the obtained planetary properties to that of the parent stars.Methods.We
  use evolution models and constraints on the stellar ages to derive the mass of heavy
  elements present in the planets. Possible additional energy sources like tidal dissipation
  due to an inclined orbit or to downward kinetic energy transport are considered.Results.We
  show that the nine transiting planets discovered so far belong to a quite homogeneous
  ensemble that is characterized by a mass of heavy elements that is a relatively
  steep function of the stellar metallicity, from less than 20 earth masses of heavy
  elements around solar composition stars, to up to åisebox-0.5ex~100 M_ensuremathøplus
  for three times the solar metallicity (the precise values being model-dependant).
  The correlation is still to be ascertained however. Statistical tests imply a worst-case
  1/3 probability of a false positive.Conclusions.Together with the observed lack
  of giant planets in close orbits around metal-poor stars, these results appear to
  imply that heavy elements play a key role in the formation of close-in giant planets.
  The large masses of heavy elements inferred for planets orbiting metal rich stars
  was not anticipated by planet formation models and shows the need for alternative
  theories including migration and subsequent collection of planetesimals.
