 abstract = {We present a time-dependent radiative model for the atmosphere of
extrasolar planets that takes into account the eccentricity of
their orbit. In addition to the modulation of stellar
irradiation by the varying planet-star distance, the pseudo-
synchronous rotation of the planets may play a significant role.
We include both of these time-dependent effects when modeling
the planetary thermal structure. We investigate the thermal
structure and spectral characteristics for time-dependent
stellar heating for two highly eccentric planets. Finally, we
discuss observational aspects for those planets suitable for
Spitzer measurements and investigate the role of the rotation
rate.},
