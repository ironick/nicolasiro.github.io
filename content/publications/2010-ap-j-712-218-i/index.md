abstract: We present a time-dependent radiative model for the atmosphere of extrasolar
  planets that takes into account the eccentricity of their orbit. In addition to
  the modulation of stellar irradiation by the varying planet-star distance, the pseudo-
  synchronous rotation of the planets may play a significant role. We include both
  of these time-dependent effects when modeling the planetary thermal structure. We
  investigate the thermal structure and spectral characteristics for time-dependent
  stellar heating for two highly eccentric planets. Finally, we discuss observational
  aspects for those planets suitable for Spitzer measurements and investigate the
  role of the rotation rate.
