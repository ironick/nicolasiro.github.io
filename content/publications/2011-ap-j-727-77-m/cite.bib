 abstract = {Favored theories of giant planet formation center around two main
paradigms, namely the core accretion model and the gravitational
instability model. These two formation scenarios support the
hypothesis that the giant planet metallicities should be higher
or equal to that of the parent star. Meanwhile, spectra of the
transiting hot Jupiter HD189733b suggest that carbon and oxygen
abundances range from depleted to enriched with respect to the
star. Here, using a model describing the formation sequence and
composition of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk, we
determine the range of volatile abundances in the envelope of
HD189733b that is consistent with the 20-80 M
$_\ensuremathøplus$ of heavy elements estimated to be
present in the planet's envelope. We then compare the inferred
carbon and oxygen abundances to those retrieved from
spectroscopy, and we find a range of supersolar values that
directly fit both spectra and internal structure models. In some
cases, we find that the apparent contradiction between the
subsolar elemental abundances and the mass of heavy elements
predicted in HD189733b by internal structure models can be
explained by the presence of large amounts of carbon molecules
in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soots in the
upper layers of the envelope, as suggested by recent
photochemical models. A diagnostic test that would confirm the
presence of these compounds in the envelope is the detection of
acetylene. Several alternative hypotheses that could also
explain the subsolar metallicity of HD189733b are formulated:
the possibility of differential settling in its envelope, the
presence of a larger core that did not erode with time, a mass
of heavy elements lower than the one predicted by interior
models, a heavy element budget resulting from the accretion of
volatile-poor planetesimals in specific circumstances, or the
combination of all these mechanisms.},
