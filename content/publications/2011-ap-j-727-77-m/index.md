abstract: "Favored theories of giant planet formation center around two main paradigms,\
  \ namely the core accretion model and the gravitational instability model. These\
  \ two formation scenarios support the hypothesis that the giant planet metallicities\
  \ should be higher or equal to that of the parent star. Meanwhile, spectra of the\
  \ transiting hot Jupiter HD189733b suggest that carbon and oxygen abundances range\
  \ from depleted to enriched with respect to the star. Here, using a model describing\
  \ the formation sequence and composition of planetesimals in the protoplanetary\
  \ disk, we determine the range of volatile abundances in the envelope of HD189733b\
  \ that is consistent with the 20-80 M $_ensuremathøplus$ of heavy elements estimated\
  \ to be present in the planet's envelope. We then compare the inferred carbon and\
  \ oxygen abundances to those retrieved from spectroscopy, and we find a range of\
  \ supersolar values that directly fit both spectra and internal structure models.\
  \ In some cases, we find that the apparent contradiction between the subsolar elemental\
  \ abundances and the mass of heavy elements predicted in HD189733b by internal structure\
  \ models can be explained by the presence of large amounts of carbon molecules in\
  \ the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soots in the upper layers of\
  \ the envelope, as suggested by recent photochemical models. A diagnostic test that\
  \ would confirm the presence of these compounds in the envelope is the detection\
  \ of acetylene. Several alternative hypotheses that could also explain the subsolar\
  \ metallicity of HD189733b are formulated: the possibility of differential settling\
  \ in its envelope, the presence of a larger core that did not erode with time, a\
  \ mass of heavy elements lower than the one predicted by interior models, a heavy\
  \ element budget resulting from the accretion of volatile-poor planetesimals in\
  \ specific circumstances, or the combination of all these mechanisms."
