 abstract = {The detection of increased sodium absorption during primary transit
implies the presence of an atmosphere around an extrasolar
planet, and enables us to infer the structure of this
atmosphere. Sodium has only been detected in the atmospheres of
two planets to date - HD 189733b and HD 209458b. WASP-17b is the
least dense planet currently known. It has a radius
approximately twice that of Jupiter and orbits an F6-type star.
The transit signal is expected to be about five times larger
than that observed in HD 209458b. We obtained 24 spectra with
the GIRAFFE spectrograph on the VLT, eight during transit. The
integrated flux in the sodium doublet at wavelengths 5889.95 and
5895.92 ̊A was measured at bandwidths 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, 4.0,
5.0 and 6.0 \Å. We find a transit depth of 0.55
\ensuremath± 0.13 per cent at 1.5 \r̊. This suggests
that, like HD 209458b, WASP-17b has an atmosphere depleted in
sodium compared to models for a cloud-free atmosphere with solar
sodium abundance. We observe a sharp cut-off in sodium
absorption between 3.0 and 4.0 \r̊ which may indicate a
layer of clouds high in the atmosphere. Based on observations
made with ESO Telescopes at the Paranal Observatory under
programme ID 083.C-0292.},
