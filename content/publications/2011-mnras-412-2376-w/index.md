abstract: The detection of increased sodium absorption during primary transit implies
  the presence of an atmosphere around an extrasolar planet, and enables us to infer
  the structure of this atmosphere. Sodium has only been detected in the atmospheres
  of two planets to date - HD 189733b and HD 209458b. WASP-17b is the least dense
  planet currently known. It has a radius approximately twice that of Jupiter and
  orbits an F6-type star. The transit signal is expected to be about five times larger
  than that observed in HD 209458b. We obtained 24 spectra with the GIRAFFE spectrograph
  on the VLT, eight during transit. The integrated flux in the sodium doublet at wavelengths
  5889.95 and 5895.92 ̊A was measured at bandwidths 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0
  Å. We find a transit depth of 0.55 ensuremath± 0.13 per cent at 1.5 r̊. This suggests
  that, like HD 209458b, WASP-17b has an atmosphere depleted in sodium compared to
  models for a cloud-free atmosphere with solar sodium abundance. We observe a sharp
  cut-off in sodium absorption between 3.0 and 4.0 r̊ which may indicate a layer of
  clouds high in the atmosphere. Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at
  the Paranal Observatory under programme ID 083.C-0292.
