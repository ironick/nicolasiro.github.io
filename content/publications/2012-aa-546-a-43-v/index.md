abstract: "Context. The atmosphere of hot Jupiters can be probed by primary transit\
  \ and secondary eclipse spectroscopy. Owing to the intense UV irradiation, mixing,\
  \ and circulation, their chemical composition is maintained out of equilibrium and\
  \ must be modeled with kinetic models.  Aims: Our purpose is to release a chemical\
  \ network and the associated rate coefficients, developed for the temperature and\
  \ pressure range relevant to hot Jupiters atmospheres. Using this network, we study\
  \ the vertical atmospheric composition of the two hot Jupiters (HD 209458b and HD\
  \ 189733b) with a model that includes photolyses and vertical mixing, and we produce\
  \ synthetic spectra.  Methods: The chemical scheme has been derived from applied\
  \ combustion models that were methodically validated over a range of temperatures\
  \ and pressures typical of the atmospheric layers influencing the observations of\
  \ hot Jupiters. We compared the predictions obtained from this scheme with equilibrium\
  \ calculations, with different schemes available in the literature that contain\
  \ N-bearing species, and with previously published photochemical models.  Results:\
  \ Compared to other chemical schemes that were not subjected to the same systematic\
  \ validation, we find significant differences whenever nonequilibrium processes\
  \ take place (photodissociations or vertical mixing). The deviations from the equilibrium,\
  \ hence the sensitivity to the network, are larger for HD 189733b, since we assume\
  \ a cooler atmosphere than for HD 209458b. We found that the abundances of NH$_3$\
  \ and HCN can vary by two orders of magnitude depending on the network, demonstrating\
  \ the importance of comprehensive experimental validation. A spectral feature of\
  \ NH$_3$ at 10.5 ensuremathμm is sensitive to these abundance variations and thus\
  \ to the chemical scheme.  Conclusions: Due to the influence of the kinetics, we\
  \ recommend using a validated scheme to model the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres.\
  \ The network we release is robust for temperatures within 300-2500 K and pressures\
  \ from 10 mbar up to a few hundred bars, for species made of C, H, O, and N. It\
  \ is validated for species up to 2 carbon atoms and for the main nitrogen species\
  \ (NH$_3$, HCN, N$_2$, NO$_x$). Although the influence of the kinetic scheme on\
  \ the hot Jupiters spectra remains within the current observational error bars (with\
  \ the exception of NH$_3$), it will become more important for atmospheres that are\
  \ cooler or subjected to higher UV fluxes, because they depart more from equilibrium.\
