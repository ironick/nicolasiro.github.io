abstract: We investigate the effects of atmospheric circulation on the chemistry of
  the hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We use a simplified dynamical model and a robust chemical
  network, as opposed to previous studies, which have used a three-dimensional circulation
  model coupled to a simple chemical kinetics scheme. The temperature structure and
  distribution of the main atmospheric constituents are calculated in the limit of
  an atmosphere that rotates as a solid body with an equatorial rotation rate of 1
  km s$^-1$. Such motion mimics a uniform zonal wind, which resembles the equatorial
  superrotation structure found by three-dimensional circulation models. The uneven
  heating of this tidally locked planet causes, even in the presence of such a strong
  zonal wind, large temperature contrasts, up to 800 K, between the dayside and nightside.
  This would result in important longitudinal variations of some molecular abundances
  if the atmosphere were at chemical equilibrium. The zonal wind, however, acts as
  a powerful disequilibrium process. We identify the existence of a pressure level
  of transition between two regimes, which may be located between 100 and 0.1 mbar
  depending on the molecule. Below this transition layer, chemical equilibrium holds.
  Above it, however, the zonal wind tends to homogenise the chemical composition of
  the atmosphere, bringing molecular abundances in the limb and nightside regions
  close to chemical equilibrium values characteristic of the dayside, i.e. producing
  a horizontal quenching effect in the abundances. Reasoning based on timescale arguments
  indicates that horizontal and vertical mixing are likely to compete in HD 209458b's
  atmosphere, producing a complex distribution where molecular abundances are quenched
  horizontally to dayside values and vertically to chemical equilibrium values characteristic
  of deep layers. Either assuming pure horizontal mixing or pure vertical mixing,
  we find substantial variations in the molecular abundances at the evening and morning
  limbs, up to one order of magnitude for CH$_4$. This may have consequences for the
  interpretation of transmission spectra that sample the planet's terminator of hot
  Jupiters.
