abstract: In this paper we explore the potential multistability of the climate for
  a planet around the habitable zone. We focus on conditions reminiscent to those
  of the Earth system, but our investigation has more general relevance and aims at
  presenting a general methodology for dealing with exoplanets. We describe a formalism
  able to provide a thorough analysis of the non-equilibrium thermodynamical properties
  of the climate system and explore, using a flexible climate model, how such properties
  depend on the energy input of the parent star, on the infrared atmospheric opacity,
  and on the rotation rate of the planet. We first show that it is possible to reproduce
  the multi-stability properties reminiscent of the paleoclimatologically relevant
  snowball (SB)-warm (W) conditions. We then characterise the thermodynamics of the
  simulated W and SB states, clarifying the central role of the hydrological cycle
  in shaping the irreversibility and the efficiency of the W states, and emphasizing
  the extreme diversity of the SB states, where dry conditions are realized. Thermodynamics
  provides the clue for studying the tipping points of the system and leads us to
  constructing empirical parametrizations allowing for expressing the main thermodynamic
  properties as functions of the emission temperature of the planet only. Such empirical
  functions are shown to be rather robust with respect to changing the rotation rate
  of the planet from the current terrestrial one to half of it. Furthermore, we explore
  the dynamical range where the length of the day and the length of the year are comparable.
  We clearly find that there is a critical rotation rate below which the multi-stability
  properties are lost, and the ice-albedo feedback responsible for the presence of
  SB and W conditions is damped. The bifurcation graph of the system suggests the
  presence of a phase transition in the planetary system. Such critical rotation rate
  corresponds roughly to the phase-lock 2:1 condition. Therefore, if an Earth-like
  planet is 1:1 phase-locked with respect to the parent star, only one climatic state
  would be compatible with a given set of astronomical and astrophysical parameters.
  These results have relevance for the general theory of planetary circulation and
  for the definition of necessary and sufficient conditions for habitability.
