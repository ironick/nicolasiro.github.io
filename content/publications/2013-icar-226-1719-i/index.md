abstract: The energy deposition and redistribution in hot Jupiter atmospheres is not
  well understood currently, but is a major factor for their evolution and survival.
  We present a time dependent radiative transfer model for the atmosphere of WASP-18b
  which is a massive (10M$_Jup$) hot Jupiter (T$_eq$ ensuremath∼ 2400 K) exoplanet
  orbiting an F6V star with an orbital period of only 0.94 days. Our model includes
  a simplified parametrisation of the day-to-night energy redistribution by a modulation
  of the stellar heating mimicking a solid body rotation of the atmosphere. We present
  the cases with either no rotation at all with respect to the synchronously rotating
  reference frame or a fast differential rotation. The results of the model are compared
  to previous observations of secondary eclipses of Nymeyer et al. (Nymeyer, S. et
  al. [2011]. Astrophys. J. 742, 35) with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Their observed
  planetary flux suggests that the efficiency of heat distribution from the day-side
  to the night-side of the planet is extremely inefficient. Our results are consistent
  with the fact that such large day-side fluxes can be obtained only if there is no
  rotation of the atmosphere. Additionally, we infer light curves of the planet for
  a full orbit in the two Warm Spitzer bandpassses for the two cases of rotation and
  discuss the observational differences.
