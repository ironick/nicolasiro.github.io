 abstract = {We present new light curves of the massive hot Jupiter system WASP-18
obtained with the Spitzer spacecraft covering the entire orbit
at 3.6 and 4.5 \ensuremathμm. These light curves are used
to measure the amplitude, shape and phase of the thermal phase
effect for WASP-18 b. We find that our results for the thermal
phase effect are limited to an accuracy of about 0.01 per cent
by systematic noise sources of unknown origin. At this level of
accuracy we find that the thermal phase effect has a peak-to-
peak amplitude approximately equal to the secondary eclipse
depth, has a sinusoidal shape and that the maximum brightness
occurs at the same phase as mid-occultation to within about 5
° at 3.6 \ensuremathμm and to within about 10
° at 4.5 \ensuremathμm. The shape and
amplitude of the thermal phase curve imply very low levels of
heat redistribution within the atmosphere of the planet. We also
perform a separate analysis to determine the system geometry by
fitting a light curve model to the data covering the occultation
and the transit. The secondary eclipse depths we measure at 3.6
and 4.5 \ensuremathμm are in good agreement with previous
measurements and imply a very low albedo for WASP-18 b. The
parameters of the system (masses, radii, etc.) derived from our
analysis are also in good agreement with those from previous
studies, but with improved precision. We use new high-resolution
imaging and published limits on the rate of change of the mean
radial velocity to check for the presence of any faint companion
stars that may affect our results. We find that there is
unlikely to be any significant contribution to the flux at
Spitzer wavelengths from a stellar companion to WASP-18. We find
that there is no evidence for variations in the times of eclipse
from a linear ephemeris greater than about 100 s over 3 years.},
