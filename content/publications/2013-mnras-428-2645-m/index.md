abstract: We present new light curves of the massive hot Jupiter system WASP-18 obtained
  with the Spitzer spacecraft covering the entire orbit at 3.6 and 4.5 ensuremathμm.
  These light curves are used to measure the amplitude, shape and phase of the thermal
  phase effect for WASP-18 b. We find that our results for the thermal phase effect
  are limited to an accuracy of about 0.01 per cent by systematic noise sources of
  unknown origin. At this level of accuracy we find that the thermal phase effect
  has a peak-to- peak amplitude approximately equal to the secondary eclipse depth,
  has a sinusoidal shape and that the maximum brightness occurs at the same phase
  as mid-occultation to within about 5 ° at 3.6 ensuremathμm and to within about 10
  ° at 4.5 ensuremathμm. The shape and amplitude of the thermal phase curve imply
  very low levels of heat redistribution within the atmosphere of the planet. We also
  perform a separate analysis to determine the system geometry by fitting a light
  curve model to the data covering the occultation and the transit. The secondary
  eclipse depths we measure at 3.6 and 4.5 ensuremathμm are in good agreement with
  previous measurements and imply a very low albedo for WASP-18 b. The parameters
  of the system (masses, radii, etc.) derived from our analysis are also in good agreement
  with those from previous studies, but with improved precision. We use new high-resolution
  imaging and published limits on the rate of change of the mean radial velocity to
  check for the presence of any faint companion stars that may affect our results.
  We find that there is unlikely to be any significant contribution to the flux at
  Spitzer wavelengths from a stellar companion to WASP-18. We find that there is no
  evidence for variations in the times of eclipse from a linear ephemeris greater
  than about 100 s over 3 years.
