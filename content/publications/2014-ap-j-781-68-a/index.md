abstract: The dissipation of the tidal energy deposited on eccentric planets may induce
  a heating of the planet that affects its atmospheric thermal structure. Here we
  study the influence of tidal heating on the atmospheric composition of the eccentric
  (e = 0.16) ``hot Neptune'' GJ 436b, for which inconclusive chemical abundances are
  retrieved from multiwavelength photometric observations carried out during primary
  transit and secondary eclipse. We build up a one-dimensional model of GJ 436b's
  atmosphere in the vertical direction and compute the pressure-temperature and molecular
  abundances profiles for various plausible internal temperatures of the planet (up
  to 560 K) and metallicities (from solar to 100 times solar), using a radiative-convective
  model and a chemical model which includes thermochemical kinetics, vertical mixing,
  and photochemistry. We find that the CO/CH$_4$ abundance ratio increases with metallicity
  and tidal heating, and ranges from 1/20 to 1000 within the ranges of metallicity
  and internal temperature explored. Water vapor locks most of the oxygen and reaches
  a very high abundance, whatever the metallicity and internal temperature of the
  planet. The CO$_2$/H$_2$O abundance ratio increases dramatically with metallicity,
  and takes values between 10$^-5$-10$^-4$ with solar elemental abundances and åisebox-0.5ex~0.1
  for a metallicity 100 times solar. None of the atmospheric models based on solid
  physical and chemical grounds provide a fully satisfactory agreement with available
  observational data, although the comparison of calculated spectra and observations
  seems to point to models with a high metallicity and efficient tidal heating, in
  which high CO/CH$_4$ abundance ratios and warm temperatures in the dayside atmosphere
  are favored.
