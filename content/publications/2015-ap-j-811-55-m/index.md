abstract: We report on novel observations of HAT-P-1 aimed at constraining the optical
  transmission spectrum of the atmosphere of its transiting hot-Jupiter exoplanet.
  Ground-based differential spectrophotometry was performed over two transit windows
  using the DOLORES spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Our measurements
  imply an average planet to star radius ratio equal to R$_p$/R$_*$ = (0.1159 ensuremath±
  0.0005). This result is consistent with the value obtained from recent near-infrared
  measurements of this object, but differs from previously reported optical measurements,
  being lower by around 4.4 exoplanet scale heights. Analyzing the data over five
  different spectral bins of ensuremath∼600 ̊A wide, we observed a single peaked spectrum
  (3.7 ensuremathσ level) with a blue cutoff corresponding to the blue edge of the
  broad absorption wing of sodium and an increased absorption in the region in-between
  6180 and 7400 Å. We also infer that the width of the broad absorption wings due
  to alkali metals is likely narrower than the one implied by solar abundance clear
  atmospheric models. We interpret the result as evidence that HAT-P-1b has a partially
  clear atmosphere at optical wavelengths with a more modest contribution from an
  optical absorber than previously reported.
