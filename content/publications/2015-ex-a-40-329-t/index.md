abstract: "The discovery of almost two thousand exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly\
  \ diverse planet population. We see gas giants in few-day orbits, whole multi-planet\
  \ systems within the orbit of Mercury, and new populations of planets with masses\
  \ between that of the Earth and Neptune—all unknown in the Solar System. Observations\
  \ to date have shown that our Solar System is certainly not representative of the\
  \ general population of planets in our Milky Way. The key science questions that\
  \ urgently need addressing are therefore: What are exoplanets made of? Why are planets\
  \ as they are? How do planetary systems work and what causes the exceptional diversity\
  \ observed as compared to the Solar System? The EChO (Exoplanet Characterisation\
  \ Observatory) space mission was conceived to take up the challenge to explain this\
  \ diversity in terms of formation, evolution, internal structure and planet and\
  \ atmospheric composition. This requires in-depth spectroscopic knowledge of the\
  \ atmospheres of a large and well-defined planet sample for which precise physical,\
  \ chemical and dynamical information can be obtained. In order to fulfil this ambitious\
  \ scientific program, EChO was designed as a dedicated survey mission for transit\
  \ and eclipse spectroscopy capable of observing a large, diverse and well-defined\
  \ planet sample within its 4-year mission lifetime. The transit and eclipse spectroscopy\
  \ method, whereby the signal from the star and planet are differentiated using knowledge\
  \ of the planetary ephemerides, allows us to measure atmospheric signals from the\
  \ planet at levels of at least 10$^-4$ relative to the star. This can only be achieved\
  \ in conjunction with a carefully designed stable payload and satellite platform.\
  \ It is also necessary to provide broad instantaneous wavelength coverage to detect\
  \ as many molecular species as possible, to probe the thermal structure of the planetary\
  \ atmospheres and to correct for the contaminating effects of the stellar photosphere.\
  \ This requires wavelength coverage of at least 0.55 to 11 ensuremathμm with a goal\
  \ of covering from 0.4 to 16 ensuremathμm. Only modest spectral resolving power\
  \ is needed, with R åisebox-0.5ex~ 300 for wavelengths less than 5 ensuremathμm\
  \ and R i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 30 for wavelengths greater than this. The transit spectroscopy\
  \ technique means that no spatial resolution is required. A telescope collecting\
  \ area of about 1 m$^2$ is sufficiently large to achieve the necessary spectro-photometric\
  \ precision: for the Phase A study a 1.13 m$^2$ telescope, diffraction limited at\
  \ 3 ensuremathμm has been adopted. Placing the satellite at L2 provides a cold and\
  \ stable thermal environment as well as a large field of regard to allow efficient\
  \ time- critical observation of targets randomly distributed over the sky. EChO\
  \ has been conceived to achieve a single goal: exoplanet spectroscopy. The spectral\
  \ coverage and signal-to-noise to be achieved by EChO, thanks to its high stability\
  \ and dedicated design, would be a game changer by allowing atmospheric composition\
  \ to be measured with unparalleled exactness: at least a factor 10 more precise\
  \ and a factor 10 to 1000 more accurate than current observations. This would enable\
  \ the detection of molecular abundances three orders of magnitude lower than currently\
  \ possible and a fourfold increase from the handful of molecules detected to date.\
  \ Combining these data with estimates of planetary bulk compositions from accurate\
  \ measurements of their radii and masses would allow degeneracies associated with\
  \ planetary interior modelling to be broken, giving unique insight into the interior\
  \ structure and elemental abundances of these alien worlds. EChO would allow scientists\
  \ to study exoplanets both as a population and as individuals. The mission can target\
  \ super-Earths, Neptune-like, and Jupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate\
  \ zones (planet temperatures of 300-3000 K) of F to M-type host stars. The EChO\
  \ core science would be delivered by a three-tier survey. The EChO Chemical Census:\
  \ This is a broad survey of a few-hundred exoplanets, which allows us to explore\
  \ the spectroscopic and chemical diversity of the exoplanet population as a whole.\
  \ The EChO Origin: This is a deep survey of a subsample of tens of exoplanets for\
  \ which significantly higher signal to noise and spectral resolution spectra can\
  \ be obtained to explain the origin of the exoplanet diversity (such as formation\
  \ mechanisms, chemical processes, atmospheric escape). The EChO Rosetta Stones:\
  \ This is an ultra- high accuracy survey targeting a subsample of select exoplanets.\
  \ These will be the bright ``benchmark'' cases for which a large number of measurements\
  \ would be taken to explore temporal variations, and to obtain two and three dimensional\
  \ spatial information on the atmospheric conditions through eclipse- mapping techniques.\
  \ If EChO were launched today, the exoplanets currently observed are sufficient\
  \ to provide a large and diverse sample. The Chemical Census survey would consist\
  \ of > 160 exoplanets with a range of planetary sizes, temperatures, orbital parameters\
  \ and stellar host properties. Additionally, over the next 10 years, several new\
  \ ground- and space-based transit photometric surveys and missions will come on-line\
  \ (e.g. NGTS, CHEOPS, TESS, PLATO), which will specifically focus on finding bright,\
  \ nearby systems. The current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list\
  \ to be further optimised in the years prior to EChO's launch and enable the atmospheric\
  \ characterisation of hundreds of planets."
