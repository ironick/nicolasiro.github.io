 abstract = {[Abridged] We have only been able to comprehensively characterize the
atmospheres of a handful of transiting planets, because most
orbit faint stars. TESS will discover transiting planets
orbiting the brightest stars, enabling, in principle, an
atmospheric survey of 102̂ to 10\ ̂bright hot Jupiters and
warm sub-Neptunes. Uniform observations of such a statistically
significant sample would provide leverage to understand---and
learn from---the diversity of short-period planets. We argue
that the best way to maximize the scientific returns of TESS is
with a follow-up space mission consisting of a
åisebox-0.5ex~1 m telescope with an optical--
NIR spectrograph: it could measure molecular absorption for non-
terrestrial planets, as well as eclipses and phase variations
for the hottest jovians. Such a mission could observe up to
10\^t̂ransits per year, thus enabling it to survey a large
fraction of the bright (J<11) TESS planets. JWST could be used
to perform detailed atmospheric characterization of the most
interesting transiting targets (transit, eclipse, and---when
possible---phase-resolved spectroscopy). TESS is also expected
to discover a few temperate terrestrial planets transiting
nearby M-Dwarfs. Characterizing these worlds will be time-
intensive: JWST will need months to provide tantalizing
constraints on the presence of an atmosphere, planetary
rotational state, clouds, and greenhouse gases. Future flagship
missions should be designed to provide better constraints on the
habitability of M-Dwarf temperate terrestrial planets.},
