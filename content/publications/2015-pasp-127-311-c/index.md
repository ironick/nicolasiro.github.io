abstract: '[Abridged] We have only been able to comprehensively characterize the atmospheres
  of a handful of transiting planets, because most orbit faint stars. TESS will discover
  transiting planets orbiting the brightest stars, enabling, in principle, an atmospheric
  survey of 102̂ to 10 ̂bright hot Jupiters and warm sub-Neptunes. Uniform observations
  of such a statistically significant sample would provide leverage to understand---and
  learn from---the diversity of short-period planets. We argue that the best way to
  maximize the scientific returns of TESS is with a follow-up space mission consisting
  of a åisebox-0.5ex~1 m telescope with an optical-- NIR spectrograph: it could measure
  molecular absorption for non- terrestrial planets, as well as eclipses and phase
  variations for the hottest jovians. Such a mission could observe up to 10^t̂ransits
  per year, thus enabling it to survey a large fraction of the bright (J<11) TESS
  planets. JWST could be used to perform detailed atmospheric characterization of
  the most interesting transiting targets (transit, eclipse, and---when possible---phase-resolved
  spectroscopy). TESS is also expected to discover a few temperate terrestrial planets
  transiting nearby M-Dwarfs. Characterizing these worlds will be time- intensive:
  JWST will need months to provide tantalizing constraints on the presence of an atmosphere,
  planetary rotational state, clouds, and greenhouse gases. Future flagship missions
  should be designed to provide better constraints on the habitability of M-Dwarf
  temperate terrestrial planets.'
