abstract: " Aims: We search for Rayleigh scattering and K and Na absorption signatures\
  \ from the atmosphere of TrES-3b using ground-based transmission spectroscopy covering\
  \ the wavelength range from 530 to 950 nm as observed with the OSIRIS instrument\
  \ at the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS.  Methods: Our analysis is based on a Bayesian\
  \ approach where the light curves covering a set of given passbands are fitted jointly\
  \ with PHOENIX-calculated stellar limb darkening profiles. The analysis is carried\
  \ out assuming both white and red noise that is temporally correlated, with two\
  \ approaches (Gaussian processes and divide-by-white) to account for the red noise.\
  \  Results: An initial analysis reveals a transmission spectrum that shows a strong\
  \ Rayleigh-like increase in extinction towards the blue end of the spectrum, and\
  \ enhanced extinction around the K I resonance doublet near 767 nm. However, the\
  \ signal amplitudes are significantly larger than expected from theoretical considerations.\
  \ A detailed analysis reveals that the K I-like feature is entirely due to variability\
  \ in the telluric O$_2$ absorption, but the Rayleigh-like feature remains unexplained.\
  \ The light curves are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=``http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr''>http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.f\
  \ r</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=``http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz- bin/qcat?J/A+A/585/A114''>http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-\
