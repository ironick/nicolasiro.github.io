abstract: "Context. The launch of the exoplanet space missions obtaining exquisite\
  \ photometry from space has resulted in the discovery of thousands of planetary\
  \ systems with very different physical properties and architectures. Among them,\
  \ the exoplanet CoRoT-29b was identified in the light curves the mission obtained\
  \ in summer 2011, and presented an asymmetric transit light curve, which was tentatively\
  \ explained via the effects of gravity darkening.  Aims: Transits of CoRoT-29b are\
  \ measured with precision photometry, to characterize the reported asymmetry in\
  \ their transit shape.  Methods: Using the OSIRIS spectrograph at the 10-m GTC telescope,\
  \ we perform spectro- photometric differential observations, which allow us to both\
  \ calculate a high-accuracy photometric light curve, and a study of the color-dependence\
  \ of the transit.  Results: After careful data analysis, we find that the previously\
  \ reported asymmetry is not present in either of two transits, observed in July\
  \ 2014 and July 2015 with high photometric precisions of 300 ppm over 5 min. Due\
  \ to the relative faintness of the star, we do not reach the precision necessary\
  \ to perform transmission spectroscopy of its atmosphere, but we see no signs of\
  \ color-dependency of the transit depth or duration.  Conclusions: We conclude that\
  \ the previously reported asymmetry may have been a time-dependent phenomenon, which\
  \ did not occur in more recent epochs. Alternatively, instrumental effects in the\
  \ discovery data may need to be reconsidered. Light curves are only available at\
  \ the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=``http://cdsar c.u-strasbg.fr''>http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A>\
  \ (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=``http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz- bin/qcat?J/A+A/589/A62''>http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-\
