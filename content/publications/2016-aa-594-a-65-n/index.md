abstract: We observed the hot Jupiter <ASTROBJ>HAT-P-32b</ASTROBJ> (also known as
  HAT-P-32Ab) to determine its optical transmission spectrum by measuring the wavelength-dependent,
  planet-to-star radius ratios in the region between 518-918 nm. We used the OSIRIS
  instrument at the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) in long-slit spectroscopy mode,
  placing <ASTROBJ>HAT-P-32</ASTROBJ> and a reference star in the same slit and obtaining
  a time series of spectra covering two transit events. Using the best quality data
  set, we were able to yield 20 narrowband transit light curves, with each passband
  spanning a 20 nm wide interval. After removal of all systematic noise signals and
  light curve modeling, the uncertainties for the resulting radius ratios lie between
  337 and 972 ppm. The radius ratios show little variation with wavelength, suggesting
  a high altitude cloud layer masking any atmospheric features. Alternatively, a strong
  depletion in alkali metals or a much smaller than expected planetary atmospheric
  scale height could be responsible for the lack of atmospheric features. Our result
  of a flat transmission spectrum is consistent with a previous ground-based study
  of the optical spectrum of this planet. This agreement between independent results
  demonstrates that ground-based measurements of exoplanet atmospheres can give reliable
  and reproducible results despite the fact that the data often is heavily affected
  by systematic noise as long as the noise source is well understood and properly
  corrected. We also extract an optical spectrum of the M-dwarf companion HAT-P-32B.
  Using PHOENIX stellar atmosphere models we determine an effective temperature of
  T$_eff$ = 3187$^+60$$_-71$ K, which is slightly colder than previous studies relying
  only on broadband infrared data. The 20 narrowband and white light curves are only
  available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A hre f=``http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr''>http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A>
