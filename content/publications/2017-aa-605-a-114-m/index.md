abstract: "Context. Transiting planets offer an excellent opportunity for characterizing\
  \ the atmospheres of extrasolar planets under very different conditions from those\
  \ found in our solar system.  Aims: We are currently carrying out a ground- based\
  \ survey to obtain the transmission spectra of several extrasolar planets using\
  \ the 10 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. In this paper we investigate the extrasolar\
  \ planet WASP-48b, a hot Jupiter orbiting around an F-type star with a period of\
  \ 2.14 days.  Methods: We obtained long-slit optical spectroscopy of one transit\
  \ of WASP-48b with the Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution\
  \ Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) spectrograph. We integrated the spectrum of WASP-48\
  \ and one reference star in several channels with different wavelength ranges, creating\
  \ numerous color light curves of the transit. We fit analytic transit curves to\
  \ the data taking into account the systematic effects present in the time series\
  \ in an effort to measure the change of the planet-to- star radius ratio (R$_p$/R$_s$)\
  \ across wavelength. The change in transit depth can be compared with atmosphere\
  \ models to infer the presence of particular atomic or molecular compounds in the\
  \ atmosphere of WASP-48b.  Results: After removing the transit model and systematic\
  \ trends to the curves we reached precisions between 261 ppm and 455-755 ppm for\
  \ the white and spectroscopic light curves, respectively. We obtained R$_p$/R$_s$\
  \ uncertainty values between 0.8 × 10$^-3$ and 1.5 × 10$^-3$ for all the curves\
  \ analyzed in this work. The measured transit depth for the curves made by integrating\
  \ the wavelength range between 530 nm and 905 nm is in agreement with previous studies.\
  \ We report a relatively flat transmission spectrum for WASP-48b with no statistical\
  \ significant detection of atmospheric species, although the theoretical models\
  \ that fit the data more closely include TiO and VO. The transit light curves are\
  \ only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=``http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr''>http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.f\
