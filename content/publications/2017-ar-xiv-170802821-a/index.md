abstract: The NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program's SAG15 group has solicited, collected,
  and organized community input on high-level science questions that could be addressed
  with future direct imaging exoplanet missions and the type and quality of data answering
  these questions will require. Input was solicited through a variety of forums and
  the report draft was shared with the exoplanet community continuously during the
  period of the report development (Nov 2015 -- May 2017). The report benefitted from
  the input of over 50 exoplanet scientists and from multiple open-forum discussions
  at exoplanet and astrobiology meetings. The SAG15 team has identified three group
  of high-level questions, those that focus on the properties of planetary systems
  (Questions A1--A2), those that focus on the properties of individual planets (Questions
  B1--B4), and questions that relate to planetary processes (Questions C1--C4). The
  questions in categories A, B, and C require different target samples and often different
  observational approaches. For each questions we summarize the current body of knowledge,
  the available and future observational approaches that can directly or indirectly
  contribute to answering the question, and provide examples and general considerations
  for the target sample required.
