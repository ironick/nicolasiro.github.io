abstract: " Aims: We set out to study the atmosphere of WASP-80b, a warm inflated\
  \ gas giant with an equilibrium temperature of 800 K, using ground-based transmission\
  \ spectroscopy covering the spectral range from 520 to 910 nm. The observations\
  \ allow us to probe the existence and abundance of K and Na in WASP-80b's atmosphere,\
  \ existence of high-altitude clouds, and Rayleigh- scattering in the blue end of\
  \ the spectrum.  Methods: We observed two spectroscopic time series of WASP-80b\
  \ transits with the OSIRIS spectrograph installed in the Gran Telescopio Canarias\
  \ (GTC), and use the observations to estimate the planet's transmission spectrum\
  \ between 520 nm and 910 nm in 20 nm-wide passbands, and around the K I and Na I\
  \ resonance doublets in 6 nm-wide passbands. We jointly model three previously published\
  \ broadband datasets consisting of 27 light curves, prior to a transmission spectroscopy\
  \ analysis in order to obtain improved estimates of the planet's orbital parameters,\
  \ average radius ratio, and stellar density. The parameter posteriors from the broadband\
  \ analysis are used to set informative priors on the transmission spectroscopy analysis.\
  \ The final transmission spectroscopy analyses are carried out jointly for the two\
  \ nights using a divide-by-white approach to remove the common-mode systematics,\
  \ and Gaussian processes to model the residual wavelength-dependent systematics.\
  \  Results: We recover a flat transmission spectrum with no evidence of Rayleigh\
  \ scattering or K I or Na I absorption, and obtain an improved system characterisation\
  \ as a by-product of the broadband- and GTC-dataset modelling. The transmission\
  \ spectra estimated separately from the two observing runs are consistent with each\
  \ other, as are the transmission spectra estimated using either a parametric or\
  \ nonparametric systematics model. The flat transmission spectrum favours an atmosphere\
  \ model with high-altitude clouds over cloud-free models with stellar or sub-stellar\
  \ metallicities.  Conclusions: Our results disagree with the recently published\
  \ discovery of strong K I absorption in WASP-80b's atmosphere based on ground-based\
  \ transmission spectroscopy with FORS2 at VLT. The analysis code with the raw and\
  \ processed data are publicly available through GitHub from <A href=``http://github.com/hpparvi/Parviainen-2017-WASP-80b''>http\
  \ s://github.com/hpparvi/Parviainen-2017-WASP-80b</A>"
