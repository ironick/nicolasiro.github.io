abstract: "Thousands of exoplanets have now been discovered with a huge range of masses,
   sizes and orbits: from rocky Earth-like planets to large gas giants grazing the
   surface of their host star. However, the essential nature of these exoplanets
   remains largely mysterious: there is no known, discernible pattern linking the
   presence, size, or orbital parameters of a planet to the nature of its parent
   star. We have little idea whether the chemistry of a planet is linked to its formation
   environment, or whether the type of host star drives the physics and chemistry
   of the planet's birth, and evolution. ARIEL was conceived to observe a large number
   ( 1000) of transiting planets for statistical understanding, including gas giants,
   Neptunes, super-Earths and Earth-size planets around a range of host star types
   using transit spectroscopy in the 1.25-7.8 ensuremathμm spectral range and multiple
   narrow-band photometry in the optical. ARIEL will focus on warm and hot planets
   to take advantage of their well-mixed atmospheres which should show minimal condensation
   and sequestration of high-Z materials compared to their colder Solar System siblings.
   Said warm and hot atmospheres are expected to be more representative of the planetary
   bulk composition. Observations of these warm/hot exoplanets, and in particular
   of their elemental composition (especially C, O, N, S, Si), will allow the understanding
   of the early stages of planetary and atmospheric formation during the nebular
   phase and the following few million years. ARIEL will thus provide a representative
   picture of the chemical nature of the exoplanets and relate this directly to the
   type and chemical environment of the host star. ARIEL is designed as a dedicated
   survey mission for combined-light spectroscopy, capable of observing a large and
   well-defined planet sample within its 4-year mission lifetime. Transit, eclipse
   and phase-curve spectroscopy methods, whereby the signal from the star and planet
   are differentiated using knowledge of the planetary ephemerides, allow us to measure
   atmospheric signals from the planet at levels of 10-100 part per million (ppm)
   relative to the star and, given the bright nature of targets, also allows more
   sophisticated techniques, such as eclipse mapping, to give a deeper insight into
   the nature of the atmosphere. These types of observations require a stable payload
   and satellite platform with broad, instantaneous wavelength coverage to detect
   many molecular species, probe the thermal structure, identify clouds and monitor
   the stellar activity. The wavelength range proposed covers all the expected major
   atmospheric gases from e.g. H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ NH$_3$, HCN, H$_2$S through
   to the more exotic metallic compounds, such as TiO, VO, and condensed species.
   Simulations of ARIEL performance in conducting exoplanet surveys have been performed
   - using conservative estimates of mission performance and a full model of all
   significant noise sources in the measurement - using a list of potential ARIEL
   targets that incorporates the latest available exoplanet statistics. The conclusion
   at the end of the Phase A study, is that ARIEL - in line with the stated mission
   objectives - will be able to observe about 1000 exoplanets depending on the details
   of the adopted survey strategy, thus confirming the feasibility of the main science
   objectives."

Thousands of exoplanets have now been discovered with a huge range of masses,
