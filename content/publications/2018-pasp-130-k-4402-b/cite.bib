 abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) presents the opportunity to
transform our understanding of planets and the origins of life
by revealing the atmospheric compositions, structures, and
dynamics of transiting exoplanets in unprecedented detail.
However, the high-precision, timeseries observations required
for such investigations have unique technical challenges, and
prior experience with Hubble, Spitzer, and other facilities
indicates that there will be a steep learning curve when JWST
becomes operational. In this paper, we describe the science
objectives and detailed plans of the Transiting Exoplanet
Community Early Release Science (ERS) Program, which is a
recently approved program for JWST observations early in Cycle
1. We also describe the simulations used to establish the
program. The goal of this project, for which the obtained data
will have no exclusive access period, is to accelerate the
acquisition and diffusion of technical expertise for transiting
exoplanet observations with JWST, while also providing a
compelling set of representative data sets that will enable
immediate scientific breakthroughs. The Transiting Exoplanet
Community ERS Program will exercise the timeseries modes of all
four JWST instruments that have been identified as the consensus
highest priorities, observe the full suite of transiting planet
characterization geometries (transits, eclipses, and phase
curves), and target planets with host stars that span an
illustrative range of brightnesses. The observations in this
program were defined through an inclusive and transparent
process that had participation from JWST instrument experts and
international leaders in transiting exoplanet studies. The
targets have been vetted with previous measurements, will be
observable early in the mission, and have exceptional scientific
merit. Community engagement in the project will be centered on a
two-phase Data Challenge that culminates with the delivery of
planetary spectra, timeseries instrument performance reports,
and open-source data analysis toolkits in time to inform the
agenda for Cycle 2 of the JWST mission.},
