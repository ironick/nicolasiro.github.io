abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) presents the opportunity to transform
  our understanding of planets and the origins of life by revealing the atmospheric
  compositions, structures, and dynamics of transiting exoplanets in unprecedented
  detail. However, the high-precision, timeseries observations required for such investigations
  have unique technical challenges, and prior experience with Hubble, Spitzer, and
  other facilities indicates that there will be a steep learning curve when JWST becomes
  operational. In this paper, we describe the science objectives and detailed plans
  of the Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science (ERS) Program, which
  is a recently approved program for JWST observations early in Cycle 1. We also describe
  the simulations used to establish the program. The goal of this project, for which
  the obtained data will have no exclusive access period, is to accelerate the acquisition
  and diffusion of technical expertise for transiting exoplanet observations with
  JWST, while also providing a compelling set of representative data sets that will
  enable immediate scientific breakthroughs. The Transiting Exoplanet Community ERS
  Program will exercise the timeseries modes of all four JWST instruments that have
  been identified as the consensus highest priorities, observe the full suite of transiting
  planet characterization geometries (transits, eclipses, and phase curves), and target
  planets with host stars that span an illustrative range of brightnesses. The observations
  in this program were defined through an inclusive and transparent process that had
  participation from JWST instrument experts and international leaders in transiting
  exoplanet studies. The targets have been vetted with previous measurements, will
  be observable early in the mission, and have exceptional scientific merit. Community
  engagement in the project will be centered on a two-phase Data Challenge that culminates
  with the delivery of planetary spectra, timeseries instrument performance reports,
  and open-source data analysis toolkits in time to inform the agenda for Cycle 2
  of the JWST mission.
