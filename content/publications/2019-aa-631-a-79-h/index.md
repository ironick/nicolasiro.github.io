abstract: 'Context. Of the presently known ensuremath≈3900 exoplanets, sparse spectral
  observations are available for ensuremath≈100. Ultra-hot Jupiters have recently
  attracted interest from observers and theoreticians alike, as they provide observationally
  accessible test cases. Confronting detailed theoretical models with observations
  is of preeminent importance in preparation for upcoming space-based telescopes.  Aims:
  We aim to study cloud formation on the ultra-hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b, the resulting
  composition of the local gas phase, and how their global changes affect wavelength-
  dependent observations utilised to derive fundamental properties of the planet.  Methods:
  We apply a hierarchical modelling approach as a virtual laboratory to study cloud
  formation and gas-phase chemistry. We utilise 97 vertical 1D profiles of a 3D GCM
  for HAT-P-7b to evaluate our kinetic cloud formation model consistently with the
  local equilibrium gas- phase composition. We use maps and slice views to provide
  a global understanding of the cloud and gas chemistry.  Results: The day/night temperature
  difference on HAT-P-7b (ensuremathΔT ensuremath≈ 2500 K) causes clouds to form on
  the nightside (dominated by H$_2$/He) while the dayside (dominated by H/He) retains
  cloud-free equatorial regions. The cloud particles vary in composition and size
  throughout the vertical extension of the cloud, but also globally. TiO$_2$[s]/Al$_2$O$_3$[s]/CaTiO$_3$[s]-particles
  of cm- sized radii occur in the higher dayside-latitudes, resulting in a dayside
  dominated by gas-phase opacity. The opacity on the nightside, however, is dominated
  by 0.01textellipsis0.1ensuremathμm particles made of a material mix dominated by
  silicates. The gas pressure at which the atmosphere becomes optically thick is 10$^-4$
  bar in cloudy regions, and 0.1 bar in cloud-free regions.  Conclusions: HAT-P-7b
  features strong morning/evening terminator asymmetries, providing an example of
  patchy clouds and azimuthally-inhomogeneous chemistry. Variable terminator properties
  may be accessible by ingress/egress transmission photometry (e.g., CHEOPS and PLATO)
  or spectroscopy. The large temperature differences of ensuremath≈2500 K result in
  an increasing geometrical extension from the night- to the dayside. The H$_2$O abundance
  at the terminator changes by <1 dex with altitude and ensuremathłesssim0.3 dex (a
  factor of 2) across the terminator for a given pressure, indicating that H$_2$O
  abundances derived from transmission spectra can be representative of the well-mixed
  metallicity at P ensuremathgtrsim 10 bar. We suggest the atmospheric C/O as an important
  tool to trace the presence and location of clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. The
  atmospheric C/O can be sub- and supersolar due to cloud formation. Phase curve variability
  of HAT-P-7b is unlikely to be caused by dayside clouds.'

Context. Of the presently known ensuremath≈3900 exoplanets, sparse spectral
  observations are available for ensuremath≈100. Ultra-hot Jupiters have recently
  attracted interest from observers and theoreticians alike, as they provide observationally
  accessible test cases. Confronting detailed theoretical models with observations
  is of preeminent importance in preparation for upcoming space-based telescopes.  Aims:
  We aim to study cloud formation on the ultra-hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b, the resulting
  composition of the local gas phase, and how their global changes affect wavelength-
  dependent observations utilised to derive fundamental properties of the planet.  Methods:
  We apply a hierarchical modelling approach as a virtual laboratory to study cloud
  formation and gas-phase chemistry. We utilise 97 vertical 1D profiles of a 3D GCM
  for HAT-P-7b to evaluate our kinetic cloud formation model consistently with the
  local equilibrium gas- phase composition. We use maps and slice views to provide
  a global understanding of the cloud and gas chemistry.  Results: The day/night temperature
  difference on HAT-P-7b (ensuremathΔT ensuremath≈ 2500 K) causes clouds to form on
  the nightside (dominated by H$_2$/He) while the dayside (dominated by H/He) retains
