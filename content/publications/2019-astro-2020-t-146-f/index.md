abstract: We are now in the new era of the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres.
  However, atmosphere models are often limited by insufficiencies in the laboratory
  and theoretical data that serve as critical inputs. Here we provide descriptions
  of areas where new investigations could fill critical gaps in our ability to model
  exoplanet atmospheres.
