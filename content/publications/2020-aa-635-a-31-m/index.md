abstract: ' Aims: The atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are commonly considered
  to be at thermochemical equilibrium. We aim to provide disequilibrium chemistry
  maps for a global understanding of the chemistry in the atmosphere of HAT-P-7b and
  assess the importance of disequilibrium chemistry on UHJs.  Methods: We applied
  a hierarchical modeling approach using 97 1D atmospheric profiles from a 3D general
  circulation model of HAT-P-7b. For each atmospheric 1D profile, we evaluated our
  kinetic cloud formation model consistently with the local gas-phase composition
  in chemical equilibrium. This served as input to study the quenching of dominating
  CHNO- binding molecules. We evaluated quenching results from a zeroth- order approximation
  in comparison to a kinetic gas-phase approach.  Results: We find that the zeroth-order
  approach of estimating quenching points agrees well with the full gas-kinetic modeling
  results. However, it underestimates the quenching levels by about one order of magnitude
  at high temperatures. Chemical disequilibrium has the greatest effect on the nightside
  and morning abundance of species such as H, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, HCN, and all
  C$_n$H$_m$ molecules; heavier C$_n$H$_m$ molecules are more affected by disequilibrium
  processes. The CO abundance, however, is affected only marginally. While dayside
  abundances also notably change, those around the evening terminator of HAT-P-7b
  are the least affected by disequilibrium processes. The latter finding may partially
  explain the consistency of observed transmission spectra of UHJs with atmospheres
  in thermochemical equilibrium. Photochemistry only negligibly affects molecular
  abundances and quenching levels.  Conclusions: In general, the quenching points
  of the atmosphere of HAT-P-7b are at much lower pressures than in the cooler hot-jupiters.
  We propose several avenues to determining the effect of disequilibrium processes
  on UHJs that are in general based on abundance and opacity measurements at different
  local times. It remains a challenge to completely disentangle this from the chemical
  effects of clouds and that of a primordial nonsolar abundance.'

  to be at thermochemical equilibrium. We aim to provide disequilibrium chemistry
  maps for a global understanding of the chemistry in the atmosphere of HAT-P-7b and
  assess the importance of disequilibrium chemistry on UHJs.  Methods: We applied
