 abstract = {Context. Ultra-hot Jupiters are the hottest exoplanets that have been
discovered so far. They present a unique possibility to explore
hot and cold chemistry on one object. The tidally locked ultra-
hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b has a day-to-night temperature difference
of ≃2500 K, confining cloud formation to the nightside and
efficient ionisation to the dayside. Both have distinct
observational signatures. \ Aims: We analyse plasma
and magnetic processes in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot
Jupiter HAT-P-7b to investigate the formation of an ionosphere
and the possibility of magnetically coupling the atmospheric gas
as the base for an extended exosphere. We show which ions and
atoms may be used as spectral tracers, and if and where
conditions for lightning may occur within the clouds of
HAT-P-7b. \ Methods: We used 3D modelling results
as input for a kinetic cloud formation code and evaluated
characteristic plasma and magnetic coupling parameters. A local
thermodynamical equilibrium radiative transfer was solved for
the ionised gas phase. This study is confined to thermal
ionisation only. \ Results: The ionisation
throughout HAT-P-7b's atmosphere varies drastically between day-
and nightside. The dayside has high levels of thermal ionisation
and long-range electromagnetic interactions dominate over
kinetic electron-neutral interactions, suggesting a day-night
difference in magnetic coupling. K$^+$, Na$^+$, Li$^+$,
Ca$^+$, and Al$^+$ are more abundant than their atomic
counterparts on the dayside. The minimum magnetic flux density
for electrons for magnetic coupling is B < 0.5 G for all regions
of HAT-P-7b's atmosphere. \ Conclusions: HAT-P-7b's
dayside has an asymmetric ionosphere that extends deep into the
atmosphere, the nightside has no thermally driven ionosphere. A
corresponding asymmetry is imprinted in the ion and neutral
composition at the terminators. The ionosphere on HAT-P-7b may
be directly traced by the Ca$^+$ H&K lines if the local
temperature is \ensuremath≥5000 K. The whole atmosphere
may couple to a global, large-scale magnetic field, and
lightning may occur on the nightside.},
