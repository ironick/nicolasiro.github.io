abstract: "Context. Ultra-hot Jupiters are the hottest exoplanets that have been discovered
   so far. They present a unique possibility to explore hot and cold chemistry on
   one object. The tidally locked ultra- hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b has a day-to-night
   temperature difference of ≃2500 K, confining cloud formation to the nightside
   and efficient ionisation to the dayside. Both have distinct observational signatures.
    Aims: We analyse plasma and magnetic processes in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot
   Jupiter HAT-P-7b to investigate the formation of an ionosphere and the possibility
   of magnetically coupling the atmospheric gas as the base for an extended exosphere.
   We show which ions and atoms may be used as spectral tracers, and if and where
   conditions for lightning may occur within the clouds of HAT-P-7b.  Methods: We
   used 3D modelling results as input for a kinetic cloud formation code and evaluated
   characteristic plasma and magnetic coupling parameters. A local thermodynamical
   equilibrium radiative transfer was solved for the ionised gas phase. This study\
   is confined to thermal ionisation only.  Results: The ionisation throughout HAT-P-7b's
   atmosphere varies drastically between day- and nightside. The dayside has high
   levels of thermal ionisation and long-range electromagnetic interactions dominate
   over kinetic electron-neutral interactions, suggesting a day-night difference
   in magnetic coupling. K$^+$, Na$^+$, Li$^+$, Ca$^+$, and Al$^+$ are more abundant
   than their atomic counterparts on the dayside. The minimum magnetic flux density
   for electrons for magnetic coupling is B < 0.5 G for all regions of HAT-P-7b's
   atmosphere.  Conclusions: HAT-P-7b's dayside has an asymmetric ionosphere that
   extends deep into the atmosphere, the nightside has no thermally driven ionosphere.
   A corresponding asymmetry is imprinted in the ion and neutral composition at the
   terminators. The ionosphere on HAT-P-7b may be directly traced by the Ca$^+$ H&K
   lines if the local temperature is ensuremath≥5000 K. The whole atmosphere may
   couple to a global, large-scale magnetic field, and lightning may occur on the
   nightside."

Context. Ultra-hot Jupiters are the hottest exoplanets that have been discovered
   so far. They present a unique possibility to explore hot and cold chemistry on
   one object. The tidally locked ultra- hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b has a day-to-night
   temperature difference of ≃2500 K, confining cloud formation to the nightside
   and efficient ionisation to the dayside. Both have distinct observational signatures.

   Jupiter HAT-P-7b to investigate the formation of an ionosphere and the possibility
   of magnetically coupling the atmospheric gas as the base for an extended exosphere.
