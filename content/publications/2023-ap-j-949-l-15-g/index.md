abstract: Carbon monoxide (CO) is predicted to be the dominant carbon-bearing molecule
  in giant planet atmospheres and, along with water, is important for discerning the
  oxygen and therefore carbon-to- oxygen ratio of these planets. The fundamental absorption
  mode of CO has a broad, double-branched structure composed of many individual absorption
  lines from 4.3 to 5.1 ensuremathμm, which can now be spectroscopically measured
  with JWST. Here we present a technique for detecting the rotational sub-band structure
  of CO at medium resolution with the NIRSpec G395H instrument. We use a single transit
  observation of the hot Jupiter WASP-39b from the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community
  Early Release Science (JTEC ERS) program at the native resolution of the instrument
  (R åisebox-0.5ex~ 2700) to resolve the CO absorption structure. We robustly detect
  absorption by CO, with an increase in transit depth of 264 ensuremath± 68 ppm, in
  agreement with the predicted CO contribution from the best-fit model at low resolution.
  This detection confirms our theoretical expectations that CO is the dominant carbon-bearing
  molecule in WASP-39b's atmosphere and further supports the conclusions of low C/O
  and supersolar metallicities presented in the JTEC ERS papers for WASP-39b.
