abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) is a key chemical species that is found in a wide
  range of planetary atmospheres. In the context of exoplanets, CO$_2$ is an indicator
  of the metal enrichment (that is, elements heavier than helium, also called `metallicity')$^1-3$,
  and thus the formation processes of the primary atmospheres of hot gas giants$^4-6$.
  It is also one of the most promising species to detect in the secondary atmospheres
  of terrestrial exoplanets$^7-9$. Previous photometric measurements of transiting
  planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have given hints of the presence of CO$_2$,
  but have not yielded definitive detections owing to the lack of unambiguous spectroscopic
  identification$^10-12$. Here we present the detection of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere
  of the gas giant exoplanet WASP-39b from transmission spectroscopy observations
  obtained with JWST as part of the Early Release Science programme$^13,14$. The data
  used in this study span 3.0-5.5 micrometres in wavelength and show a prominent CO$_2$
  absorption feature at 4.3 micrometres (26-sigma significance). The overall spectrum
  is well matched by one-dimensional, ten- times solar metallicity models that assume
  radiative-convective- thermochemical equilibrium and have moderate cloud opacity.
  These models predict that the atmosphere should have water, carbon monoxide and
  hydrogen sulfide in addition to CO$_2$, but little methane. Furthermore, we also
  tentatively detect a small absorption feature near 4.0 micrometres that is not reproduced
  by these models.
