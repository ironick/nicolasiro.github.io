abstract: Measuring the metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio in exoplanet
  atmospheres is a fundamental step towards constraining the dominant chemical processes
  at work and, if in equilibrium, revealing planet formation histories. Transmission
  spectroscopy (for example, refs. $^1,2$) provides the necessary means by constraining
  the abundances of oxygen- and carbon-bearing species; however, this requires broad
  wavelength coverage, moderate spectral resolution and high precision, which, together,
  are not achievable with previous observatories. Now that JWST has commenced science
  operations, we are able to observe exoplanets at previously uncharted wavelengths
  and spectral resolutions. Here we report time-series observations of the transiting
  exoplanet WASP-39b using JWST's Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam). The long-wavelength
  spectroscopic and short- wavelength photometric light curves span 2.0-4.0 micrometres,
  exhibit minimal systematics and reveal well defined molecular absorption features
  in the planet's spectrum. Specifically, we detect gaseous water in the atmosphere
  and place an upper limit on the abundance of methane. The otherwise prominent carbon
  dioxide feature at 2.8 micrometres is largely masked by water. The best-fit chemical
  equilibrium models favour an atmospheric metallicity of 1-100-times solar (that
  is, an enrichment of elements heavier than helium relative to the Sun) and a substellar
  C/O ratio. The inferred high metallicity and low C/O ratio may indicate significant
  accretion of solid materials during planet formation (for example, refs. $^3,4$$^,$)
  or disequilibrium processes in the upper atmosphere (for example, refs. $^5,6$).
