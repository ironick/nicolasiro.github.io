abstract: Transmission spectroscopy$^1-3$ of exoplanets has revealed signatures of
  water vapour, aerosols and alkali metals in a few dozen exoplanet atmospheres$^4,5$.
  However, these previous inferences with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes
  were hindered by the observations' relatively narrow wavelength range and spectral
  resolving power, which precluded the unambiguous identification of other chemical
  species—in particular the primary carbon-bearing molecules$^6,7$. Here we report
  a broad-wavelength 0.5-5.5 textmum atmospheric transmission spectrum of WASP-39b$^8$,
  a 1,200 K, roughly Saturn-mass, Jupiter-radius exoplanet, measured with the JWST
  NIRSpec's PRISM mode$^9$ as part of the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early
  Release Science Team Program$^10-12$. We robustly detect several chemical species
  at high significance, including Na (19σ), H$_2$O (33σ), CO$_2$
  (28σ) and CO (7σ). The non-detection of CH$_4$, combined with
  a strong CO$_2$ feature, favours atmospheric models with a super-solar atmospheric
  metallicity. An unanticipated absorption feature at 4 textmum is best explained
  by SO$_2$ (2.7σ), which could be a tracer of atmospheric photochemistry.
  These observations demonstrate JWST's sensitivity to a rich diversity of exoplanet
  compositions and chemical processes.

Transmission spectroscopy$^1-3$ of exoplanets has revealed signatures of
  water vapour, aerosols and alkali metals in a few dozen exoplanet atmospheres$^4,5$.
  However, these previous inferences with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes
  were hindered by the observations' relatively narrow wavelength range and spectral
  resolving power, which precluded the unambiguous identification of other chemical
  species—in particular the primary carbon-bearing molecules$^6,7$. Here we report
  a broad-wavelength 0.5-5.5 textmum atmospheric transmission spectrum of WASP-39b$^8$,
  a 1,200 K, roughly Saturn-mass, Jupiter-radius exoplanet, measured with the JWST
  NIRSpec's PRISM mode$^9$ as part of the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early
  Release Science Team Program$^10-12$. We robustly detect several chemical species
  at high significance, including Na (19σ), H$_2$O (33σ), CO$_2$
  (28σ) and CO (7σ). The non-detection of CH$_4$, combined with
  a strong CO$_2$ feature, favours atmospheric models with a super-solar atmospheric
  metallicity. An unanticipated absorption feature at 4 textmum is best explained
  by SO$_2$ (2.7σ), which could be a tracer of atmospheric photochemistry.
  These observations demonstrate JWST's sensitivity to a rich diversity of exoplanet
  compositions and chemical processes.
