abstract: Measuring the abundances of carbon and oxygen in exoplanet atmospheres is
  considered a crucial avenue for unlocking the formation and evolution of exoplanetary
  systems$^1,2$. Access to the chemical inventory of an exoplanet requires high-precision
  observations, often inferred from individual molecular detections with low-resolution
  space-based$^3-5$ and high- resolution ground-based$^6-8$ facilities. Here we report
  the medium-resolution (R ensuremath≈ 600) transmission spectrum of an exoplanet
  atmosphere between 3 and 5 ensuremathμm covering several absorption features for
  the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b (ref. $^9$), obtained with the Near Infrared
  Spectrograph (NIRSpec) G395H grating of JWST. Our observations achieve 1.46 times
  photon precision, providing an average transit depth uncertainty of 221 ppm per
  spectroscopic bin, and present minimal impacts from systematic effects. We detect
  significant absorption from CO$_2$ (28.5ensuremathσ) and H$_2$O (21.5ensuremathσ),
  and identify SO$_2$ as the source of absorption at 4.1 ensuremathμm (4.8ensuremathσ).
  Best-fit atmospheric models range between 3 and 10 times solar metallicity, with
  sub-solar to solar C/O ratios. These results, including the detection of SO$_2$,
  underscore the importance of characterizing the chemistry in exoplanet atmospheres
  and showcase NIRSpec G395H as an excellent mode for time-series observations over
  this critical wavelength range$^10$.
