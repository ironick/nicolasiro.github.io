abstract: The Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b has been the subject of extensive efforts
  to determine its atmospheric properties using transmission spectroscopy$^1-4$. However,
  these efforts have been hampered by modelling degeneracies between composition and
  cloud properties that are caused by limited data quality$^5-9$. Here we present
  the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b obtained using the Single-Object Slitless
  Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode of the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS)
  instrument on the JWST. This spectrum spans 0.6-2.8 ensuremathμm in wavelength and
  shows several water-absorption bands, the potassium resonance doublet and signatures
  of clouds. The precision and broad wavelength coverage of NIRISS/SOSS allows us
  to break model degeneracies between cloud properties and the atmospheric composition
  of WASP-39b, favouring a heavy-element enhancement (`metallicity') of about 10-30
  times the solar value, a sub-solar carbon-to- oxygen (C/O) ratio and a solar-to-super-solar
  potassium-to- oxygen (K/O) ratio. The observations are also best explained by wavelength-dependent,
  non-grey clouds with inhomogeneous coverageof the planet's terminator.
