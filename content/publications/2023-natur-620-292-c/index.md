abstract: Close-in giant exoplanets with temperatures greater than 2,000 K ('ultra-hot
  Jupiters') have been the subject of extensive efforts to determine their atmospheric
  properties using thermal emission measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
  and Spitzer Space Telescope$^1-3$. However, previous studies have yielded inconsistent
  results because the small sizes of the spectral features and the limited information
  content of the data resulted in high sensitivity to the varying assumptions made
  in the treatment of instrument systematics and the atmospheric retrieval analysis$^3-12$.
  Here we present a dayside thermal emission spectrum of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18b
  obtained with the NIRISS$^13$ instrument on the JWST. The data span 0.85 to 2.85
  ensuremathμm in wavelength at an average resolving power of 400 and exhibit minimal
  systematics. The spectrum shows three water emission features (at >6σ
  confidence) and evidence for optical opacity, possibly attributable to H$^$,
  TiO and VO (combined significance of 3.8σ). Models that fit the data require
  a thermal inversion, molecular dissociation as predicted by chemical equilibrium,
  a solar heavy-element abundance ('metallicity', M/H =1.0 3$_-0.51$$^+1.11$
  times solar) and a carbon- to-oxygen (C/O) ratio less than unity. The data also
  yield a dayside brightness temperature map, which shows a peak in temperature near
  the substellar point that decreases steeply and symmetrically with longitude towards
  the terminators.

Close-in giant exoplanets with temperatures greater than 2,000 K ('ultra-hot
  Jupiters') have been the subject of extensive efforts to determine their atmospheric
  properties using thermal emission measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
  and Spitzer Space Telescope$^1-3$. However, previous studies have yielded inconsistent
  results because the small sizes of the spectral features and the limited information
  content of the data resulted in high sensitivity to the varying assumptions made
  in the treatment of instrument systematics and the atmospheric retrieval analysis$^3-12$.
  Here we present a dayside thermal emission spectrum of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18b
  obtained with the NIRISS$^13$ instrument on the JWST. The data span 0.85 to 2.85
  ensuremathμm in wavelength at an average resolving power of 400 and exhibit minimal
  systematics. The spectrum shows three water emission features (at >6σ
  confidence) and evidence for optical opacity, possibly attributable to H$^-$,
  TiO and VO (combined significance of 3.8σ). Models that fit the data require
  a thermal inversion, molecular dissociation as predicted by chemical equilibrium,
  a solar heavy-element abundance ('metallicity', M/H =1.0 3$_-0.51$$^+1.11$
  times solar) and a carbon- to-oxygen (C/O) ratio less than unity. The data also
  yield a dayside brightness temperature map, which shows a peak in temperature near
  the substellar point that decreases steeply and symmetrically with longitude towards
  the terminators.
