abstract: Ultracool dwarf stars are abundant, long-lived and uniquely suited to enable
  the atmospheric study of transiting terrestrial companions with the JWST. Among
  them, the most prominent is the M8.5V star TRAPPIST-1 and its seven planets. While
  JWST Cycle 1 observations have started to yield preliminary insights into the planets,
  they have also revealed that their atmospheric exploration requires a better understanding
  of their host star. Here we propose a roadmap to characterize the TRAPPIST-1 system
  — and others like it — in an efficient and robust manner with JWST. We notably recommend
  that — although more challenging to schedule — multi-transit windows be prioritized
  to mitigate the effects of stellar activity and gather up to twice more transits
  per JWST hour spent. We conclude that, for such systems, planets cannot be studied
  in isolation by small programmes but rather need large-scale, joint space- and ground-
  based initiatives to fully exploit the capabilities of JWST for the exploration
  of terrestrial planets.
