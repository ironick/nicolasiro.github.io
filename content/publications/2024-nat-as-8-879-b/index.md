abstract: Hot Jupiters are among the best-studied exoplanets, but it is still poorly
  understood how their chemical composition and cloud properties vary with longitude.
  Theoretical models predict that clouds may condense on the nightside and that molecular
  abundances can be driven out of equilibrium by zonal winds. Here we report a phase-resolved
  emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b measured from 5 ensuremathμm to 12
  ensuremathμm with the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument. The spectra reveal a large
  day-night temperature contrast (with average brightness temperatures of 1,524 ensuremath±
  35 K and 863 ensuremath± 23 K, respectively) and evidence for water absorption at
  all orbital phases. Comparisons with three- dimensional atmospheric models show
  that both the phase-curve shape and emission spectra strongly suggest the presence
  of nightside clouds that become optically thick to thermal emission at pressures
  greater than åisebox-0.5ex~100 mbar. The dayside is consistent with a cloudless
  atmosphere above the mid-infrared photosphere. Contrary to expectations from equilibrium
  chemistry but consistent with disequilibrium kinetics models, methane is not detected
  on the nightside (2ensuremathσ upper limit of 1-6 ppm, depending on model assumptions).
  Our results provide strong evidence that the atmosphere of WASP-43b is shaped by
  disequilibrium processes and provide new insights into the properties of the planet's
  nightside clouds. However, the remaining discrepancies between our observations
  and our predictive atmospheric models emphasize the importance of further exploring
  the effects of clouds and disequilibrium chemistry in numerical models.

Hot Jupiters are among the best-studied exoplanets, but it is still poorly
  understood how their chemical composition and cloud properties vary with longitude.
  Theoretical models predict that clouds may condense on the nightside and that molecular
  abundances can be driven out of equilibrium by zonal winds. Here we report a phase-resolved
  emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b measured from 5 ensuremathμm to 12
  ensuremathμm with the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument. The spectra reveal a large
  day-night temperature contrast (with average brightness temperatures of 1,524 ensuremath±
  35 K and 863 ensuremath± 23 K, respectively) and evidence for water absorption at
  all orbital phases. Comparisons with three- dimensional atmospheric models show
  that both the phase-curve shape and emission spectra strongly suggest the presence
  of nightside clouds that become optically thick to thermal emission at pressures
  greater than åisebox-0.5ex~100 mbar. The dayside is consistent with a cloudless
  atmosphere above the mid-infrared photosphere. Contrary to expectations from equilibrium
  chemistry but consistent with disequilibrium kinetics models, methane is not detected
  on the nightside (2ensuremathσ upper limit of 1-6 ppm, depending on model assumptions).
  Our results provide strong evidence that the atmosphere of WASP-43b is shaped by
  disequilibrium processes and provide new insights into the properties of the planet's
  nightside clouds. However, the remaining discrepancies between our observations
  and our predictive atmospheric models emphasize the importance of further exploring
  the effects of clouds and disequilibrium chemistry in numerical models.
