abstract: "As JWST begins to return observations, it is more important than ever that\
  \ exoplanet climate models can consistently and correctly predict the observability\
  \ of exoplanets, retrieval of their data, and interpretation of planetary environments\
  \ from that data. Model intercomparisons play a crucial role in this context, especially\
  \ now when few data are available to validate model predictions. The CUISINES Working\
  \ Group of NASA's Nexus for Exoplanet Systems Science supports a systematic approach\
  \ to evaluating the performance of exoplanet models and provides here a framework\
  \ for conducting community-organized exoplanet model intercomparison projects (exoMIPs).\
  \ The CUISINES framework adapts Earth climate community practices specifically for\
  \ the needs of the exoplanet researchers, encompassing a range of model types, planetary\
  \ targets, and parameter space studies. It is intended to help researchers to work\
  \ collectively, equitably, and openly toward common goals. The CUISINES framework\
  \ rests on five principles: (1) define in advance what research question(s) the\
  \ exoMIP is intended to address, (2) create an experimental design that maximizes\
  \ community participation and advertise it widely, (3) plan a project timeline that\
  \ allows all exoMIP members to participate fully, (4) generate data products from\
  \ model output for direct comparison to observations, and (5) create a data management\
  \ plan that is workable in the present and scalable for the future. Within the first\
  \ years of its existence, CUISINES is already providing logistical support to 10\
  \ exoMIPs and will continue to host annual workshops for further community feedback\
  \ and presentation of new exoMIP ideas."

As JWST begins to return observations, it is more important than ever that
   exoplanet climate models can consistently and correctly predict the observability
   of exoplanets, retrieval of their data, and interpretation of planetary environments
   from that data. Model intercomparisons play a crucial role in this context, especially
   now when few data are available to validate model predictions. The CUISINES Working
   Group of NASA's Nexus for Exoplanet Systems Science supports a systematic approach
   to evaluating the performance of exoplanet models and provides here a framework
   for conducting community-organized exoplanet model intercomparison projects (exoMIPs).
   The CUISINES framework adapts Earth climate community practices specifically for
   the needs of the exoplanet researchers, encompassing a range of model types, planetary
   targets, and parameter space studies. It is intended to help researchers to work
   collectively, equitably, and openly toward common goals. The CUISINES framework
   rests on five principles: (1) define in advance what research question(s) the
   exoMIP is intended to address, (2) create an experimental design that maximizes
   community participation and advertise it widely, (3) plan a project timeline that
   allows all exoMIP members to participate fully, (4) generate data products from
   model output for direct comparison to observations, and (5) create a data management
   plan that is workable in the present and scalable for the future. Within the first
   years of its existence, CUISINES is already providing logistical support to 10
   exoMIPs and will continue to host annual workshops for further community feedback
   and presentation of new exoMIP ideas.
