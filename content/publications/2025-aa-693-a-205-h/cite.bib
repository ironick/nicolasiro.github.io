 abstract = {Temperature-dependent biological productivity controls silicate
weathering and thereby extends the potential habitable timespan
of Earth. Models and theoretical considerations indicate that
the runaway greenhouse on Earth-like exoplanets is generally
accompanied by a dramatic increase in atmospheric H$_2$O and
CO$_2$, which might be observed with the upcoming generation
of space telescopes. If an active biosphere extends the
habitable timespan of exoplanets similarly to Earth, observing
the atmospheric spectra of exoplanets near the inner edge of the
habitable zone could then give insights into whether the planet
is inhabited. Here, we explore this idea for Earth-like
stagnant-lid planets. We find that while for a reduced mantle, a
surface biosphere extends the habitable timespan of the planet
by about 1 Gyr, for more oxidising conditions, the biologically
enhanced rate of weathering becomes increasingly compensated for
by an increased supply rate of CO$_2$ to the atmosphere.
Observationally, the resulting difference in atmospheric
CO$_2$ near the inner edge of the habitable zone is clearly
distinguishable between biotic planets with active weathering
and abiotic planets that have experienced a runaway greenhouse.
For an efficient hydrological cycle, the increased
bioproductivity also leads to a CH$_4$ biosignature observable
with JWST. As the planet becomes uninhabitable, the H$_2$O
infrared absorption bands dominate, but the 4.3-\textmum
CO$_2$ band remains a clear window into the CO$_2$
abundances. In summary, while the effect of life on the
carbonate-silicate cycle leaves a record in the atmospheric
spectrum of Earth-like stagnant-lid planets, future work is
needed especially to determine the tectonic state and
composition of exoplanets and to push forward the development of
the next generation of space telescopes.},
