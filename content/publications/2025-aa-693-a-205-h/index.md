abstract: Temperature-dependent biological productivity controls silicate weathering
  and thereby extends the potential habitable timespan of Earth. Models and theoretical
  considerations indicate that the runaway greenhouse on Earth-like exoplanets is
  generally accompanied by a dramatic increase in atmospheric H$_2$O and CO$_2$, which
  might be observed with the upcoming generation of space telescopes. If an active
  biosphere extends the habitable timespan of exoplanets similarly to Earth, observing
  the atmospheric spectra of exoplanets near the inner edge of the habitable zone
  could then give insights into whether the planet is inhabited. Here, we explore
  this idea for Earth-like stagnant-lid planets. We find that while for a reduced
  mantle, a surface biosphere extends the habitable timespan of the planet by about
  1 Gyr, for more oxidising conditions, the biologically enhanced rate of weathering
  becomes increasingly compensated for by an increased supply rate of CO$_2$ to the
  atmosphere. Observationally, the resulting difference in atmospheric CO$_2$ near
  the inner edge of the habitable zone is clearly distinguishable between biotic planets
  with active weathering and abiotic planets that have experienced a runaway greenhouse.
  For an efficient hydrological cycle, the increased bioproductivity also leads to
  a CH$_4$ biosignature observable with JWST. As the planet becomes uninhabitable,
  the H$_2$O infrared absorption bands dominate, but the 4.3-textmum CO$_2$ band remains
  a clear window into the CO$_2$ abundances. In summary, while the effect of life
  on the carbonate-silicate cycle leaves a record in the atmospheric spectrum of Earth-like
  stagnant-lid planets, future work is needed especially to determine the tectonic
  state and composition of exoplanets and to push forward the development of the next
  generation of space telescopes.
