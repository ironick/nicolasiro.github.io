abstract: Context. Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are gas giant exoplanets that are strongly
  irradiated by their star, setting intense molecular dissociation that leads to atmospheric
  chemistry dominated by ions and atoms. These conditions inhibit day-to-night heat
  redistribution, which results in high temperature contrasts. Phase-curve observations
  over several passbands offer insights on the thermal structure and properties of
  these extreme atmospheres. Aims. We aim to perform a joint analysis of multiple
  observations of WASP-18 b from the visible to the mid- infrared, using data from
  CHEOPS, TESS, and Spitzer. Our purpose is to characterise the planetary atmosphere
  with a consistent view over the large wavelength range covered, including JWST data.
  Methods. We implemented a model for the planetary signal including transits, occultations,
  phase signal, ellipsoidal variations, Doppler boosting, and light travel time. We
  performed a joint fit of more than 250 eclipse events and derived the atmospheric
  properties using general circulation models (GCMs) and retrieval analyses. Results.
  We obtained new ephemerides with unprecedented precisions of 1 second and 1.4 millisecond
  on the time of inferior conjunction and orbital period, respectively. We computed
  a planetary radius of R $_ p $ = 1.1926 ensuremath± 0.0077 R $_ J $ with a precision
  of 0.65% (or 550 km). Based on a timing inconsistency with JWST, we discuss and
  confirm the orbital eccentricity (e = 0.00852 ensuremath± 0.00091). We also constrain
  the argument of periastron to ensuremathømega = 261.9$_‑1.4$ $^+1.3$ deg. We show
  that the large dayside emission implies the presence of magnetic drag and super-solar
  metallicity. We find a steep thermally inverted gradient in the planetary atmosphere,
  which is common for UHJs. We detected the presence of strong CO emission lines at
  4.5 ensuremathμm from an excess of dayside brightness in the Spitzer/IRAC/Channel
  2 passband. Using these models to constrain the reflected contribution in the CHEOPS
  passband, we derived an extremely low geometric albedo of A$_g$ $^CHEOPS$ = 0.027
  ensuremath± 0.011. Conclusions. The orbital eccentricity remains a potential challenge
  for planetary dynamics that might require further study given the short-period massive
  planet and despite the young age of the system. The characterisation of the atmosphere
  of WASP-18 b reveals the necessity to account for magnetic friction and super-solar
  metallicity to explain the full picture of the dayside emission. We find the planetary
  dayside to be extremely unreflective; however, when juxtaposing TESS and CHEOPS
  data, we get hints of increased scattering efficiency in the visible, likely due
  to Rayleigh scattering.
