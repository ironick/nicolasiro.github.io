abstract: We report JWST/MIRI 15 μm phase curves of TRAPPIST-1 b and c, revealing
  thermal emission consistent with their irradiation levels, assuming no efficient
  heat redistribution. We find that TRAPPIST-1 b shows a high dayside brightness temperature
  (490 ± 17 K), no significantly detectable nightside emission (F[b, Night,
  max] = 39_-27^+55 ppm), and no phase offset -- features consistent with a low-albedo,
  airless ultramafic rocky surface. TRAPPIST-1 c exhibits a lower dayside brightness
  temperature (369 ± 23 K), and a nightside flux statistically indistinguishable
  from that of TRAPPIST-1 b (F[c, Night, max] = 62_-43^+60 ppm). Atmosphere models
  with surface pressures $≥$1 bar and efficient greenhouse effects are strongly disfavoured
  for both planets. TRAPPIST-1 b is unlikely to possess any substantial atmosphere,
  while TRAPPIST-1 c may retain a tenuous, greenhouse-poor O$_2$-dominated atmosphere
  or be similarly airless with a more reflective surface. These results suggest divergent
  evolutionary pathways or atmospheric loss processes, despite similar compositions.
  These measurements tightly constrain atmosphere retention in the inner TRAPPIST-1
  system.
