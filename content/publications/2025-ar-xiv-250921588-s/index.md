abstract: With JWST, observing separate spectra of the morning and evening limbs of
  hot Jupiters has finally become a reality. The first such observation was reported
  for WASP-39b, where the evening terminator was observed to have a larger transit
  radius by about 400 ppm and a stronger 4.3 μm CO2 feature than the morning
  terminator. Multiple factors, including temperature differences, photo/thermochemistry,
  clouds and hazes, could cause such limb asymmetries. To interpret these new limb
  asymmetry observations, a detailed understanding of how the relevant processes affect
  morning and evening spectra grounded in forward models is needed. Focusing on WASP-39b,
  we compare simulations from five different general circulation models (GCMs), including
  one simulating disequilibrium thermochemistry and one with cloud radiative feedback,
  to the recent WASP-39b limb asymmetry observations. We also post-process the temperature
  structures of all simulations with a 2D photochemical model and one simulation with
  a cloud microphysics model. Although the temperatures predicted by the different
  models vary considerably, the models are remarkably consistent in their predicted
  morning--evening temperature differences. Several equilibrium-chemistry simulations
  predict strong methane features in the morning spectrum, not seen in the observations.
  When including disequilibrium processes, horizontal transport homogenizes methane,
  and these methane features disappear. However, even after including photochemistry
  and clouds, our models still cannot reproduce the observed ∼2000 ppm asymmetry
  in the CO2 feature. A combination of factors, such as varying metallicity and
  unexplored parameters in cloud models, may explain the discrepancy, emphasizing
  the need for future models integrating cloud microphysics and feedback across a
  broader parameter space.

With JWST, observing separate spectra of the morning and evening limbs of
  hot Jupiters has finally become a reality. The first such observation was reported
  for WASP-39b, where the evening terminator was observed to have a larger transit
  radius by about 400 ppm and a stronger 4.3 μm CO2 feature than the morning
  terminator. Multiple factors, including temperature differences, photo/thermochemistry,
  clouds and hazes, could cause such limb asymmetries. To interpret these new limb
  asymmetry observations, a detailed understanding of how the relevant processes affect
  morning and evening spectra grounded in forward models is needed. Focusing on WASP-39b,
  we compare simulations from five different general circulation models (GCMs), including
  one simulating disequilibrium thermochemistry and one with cloud radiative feedback,
  to the recent WASP-39b limb asymmetry observations. We also post-process the temperature
