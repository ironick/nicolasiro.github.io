 abstract = {Highly-irradiated giant exoplanets known as ``ultra-hot Jupiters'' are
anticipated to exhibit large variations of atmospheric
temperature and chemistry as a function of longitude, latitude,
and altitude. Previous observations have hinted at these
variations, but the existing data have been fundamentally
restricted to probing hemisphere-integrated spectra, thereby
providing only coarse information on atmospheric gradients. Here
we present a spectroscopic eclipse map of an extrasolar planet,
resolving the atmosphere in multiple dimensions simultaneously.
We analyze a secondary eclipse of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18b
observed with the NIRISS instrument on JWST. The mapping reveals
weaker longitudinal temperature gradients than were predicted by
theoretical models, indicating the importance of hydrogen
dissociation and/or nightside clouds in shaping global thermal
emission. Additionally, we identify two thermally distinct
regions of the planet's atmosphere: a ``hotspot'' surrounding
the substellar point and a ``ring'' near the dayside limbs. The
hotspot region shows a strongly inverted thermal structure due
to the presence of optical absorbers and a water abundance
marginally lower than the hemispheric average, in accordance
with theoretical predictions. The ring region shows colder
temperatures and poorly constrained chemical abundances. Similar
future analyses will reveal three-dimensional thermal, chemical,
and dynamical properties of a broad range of exoplanet
atmospheres.},
