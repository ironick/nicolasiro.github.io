abstract: "Highly-irradiated giant exoplanets known as ''ultra-hot Jupiters'' are
   anticipated to exhibit large variations of atmospheric temperature and chemistry
   as a function of longitude, latitude, and altitude. Previous observations have
   hinted at these variations, but the existing data have been fundamentally restricted
   to probing hemisphere-integrated spectra, thereby providing only coarse information
   on atmospheric gradients. Here we present a spectroscopic eclipse map of an extrasolar
   planet, resolving the atmosphere in multiple dimensions simultaneously. We analyze
   a secondary eclipse of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18b observed with the NIRISS
   instrument on JWST. The mapping reveals weaker longitudinal temperature gradients
   than were predicted by theoretical models, indicating the importance of hydrogen
   dissociation and/or nightside clouds in shaping global thermal emission. Additionally,
   we identify two thermally distinct regions of the planet's atmosphere: a ``hotspot''
   surrounding the substellar point and a ``ring'' near the dayside limbs. The hotspot
   region shows a strongly inverted thermal structure due to the presence of optical
   absorbers and a water abundance marginally lower than the hemispheric average,
   in accordance with theoretical predictions. The ring region shows colder temperatures
   and poorly constrained chemical abundances. Similar future analyses will reveal
   three-dimensional thermal, chemical, and dynamical properties of a broad range
   of exoplanet atmospheres."

Highly-irradiated giant exoplanets known as ''ultra-hot Jupiters'' are
   anticipated to exhibit large variations of atmospheric temperature and chemistry
   as a function of longitude, latitude, and altitude. Previous observations have
   hinted at these variations, but the existing data have been fundamentally restricted
   to probing hemisphere-integrated spectra, thereby providing only coarse information
   on atmospheric gradients. Here we present a spectroscopic eclipse map of an extrasolar
   planet, resolving the atmosphere in multiple dimensions simultaneously. We analyze
   a secondary eclipse of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18b observed with the NIRISS
   instrument on JWST. The mapping reveals weaker longitudinal temperature gradients
   than were predicted by theoretical models, indicating the importance of hydrogen
   dissociation and/or nightside clouds in shaping global thermal emission. Additionally,
   we identify two thermally distinct regions of the planet's atmosphere: a ''hotspot''
   surrounding the substellar point and a "ring" near the dayside limbs. The hotspot
   region shows a strongly inverted thermal structure due to the presence of optical
   absorbers and a water abundance marginally lower than the hemispheric average,
   in accordance with theoretical predictions. The ring region shows colder temperatures
   and poorly constrained chemical abundances. Similar future analyses will reveal
