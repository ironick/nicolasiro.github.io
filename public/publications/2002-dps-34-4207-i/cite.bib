 abstract = {Both the atmospheric circulation and evolution of hot Jupiters are
strongly affected by how and where stellar energy is deposited
in their atmospheres (Guillot and Showman 2002, Showman and
Guillot 2002). Recently, the observation of HD209458b,
transiting its star, provided a measurement of its radius which,
combined with its mass, constrains for the first time
evolutionary models of hot Jupiters. The radius (obtained as a
function of time) depends strongly on the temperature obtained
at the bottom of the ``atmosphere'' (the layer which is
penetrated by the stellar flux). We present here a radiative
equilibrium model of HD209458b. Heating ang cooling derive
respectively from the absorption of the stellar flux and the
thermal emision of the planet. Radiative transfer calculations
incorporate collision-induced opacity from H$_2$-He, Rayleigh
scaterring from H$_2$ and He, bound-free absorption by
H$^-$, free-free absorption by H$_2$^-$$, molecular bands
from H$_2$O, CH$_4$ and CO, and resonance lines from alkali
metals. Abundances profiles are calculated assuming solar
elemental abundances and thermochemical equilibrium. Preliminary
results will be presented and implications on dynamical and
evolutionary models will be discussed.},
