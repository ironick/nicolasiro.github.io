 abstract = {The condensation of water in a slowly cooling dense medium, as the solar
nebula is expected to have been, forms mainly crystalline ice.
As the nebula keeps on cooling down, volatile gases are
subsequently trapped in ice in the form of clathrate-hydrates.
Using the statistical thermodynamical theory of clathrate-
hydrate formation and a simplified model for planetesimal
dynamical evolution, we calculate the composition of icy
planetesimals as a function of a single quantity: the number of
accessible ice sites. \\Using this
formalism, we interpret the depletion of N2 in comets as the
result of their formation in a region of the nebula where ice
was not abundant enough to trap all available volatiles. As
well, assuming that the feeding zone of Jupiter was relatively
enriched in water ice enables us to interpret the Galileo
measurements of atomic en- richments of C, N, S, Ar, Kr and Xe
with respect to their solar abundances.},
