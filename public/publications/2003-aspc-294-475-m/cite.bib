 abstract = {Following model predictions (Seager and Sasselov 2000; Brown 2001), the
transmission spectrum of the transiting planet HD209458b should
exhibit detectable alkali lines and molecular features in the
optical and near-IR spectrum. This paper shows an attempt to
detect HeI at 1.083 microns and optical signatures with the VLT.},
