 abstract = {The study of the light curve of the transiting planet HD209458b provided
for the first time an accurate measurement of its mass and its
radius. It represents a strong constraint on evolutionary models
of Pegasi planets. These planets should be in synchronous
rotation, and as shown by Showman & Guillot (2002), should have
a significant day/night temperature variation and zonal winds
with velocities of about 1 km/s in the photosphere. These
estimations however rely on simplified assumptions on the
radiative timescale. \\We present a
time-dependent radiative equilibrium model for the transiting
planet HD209458b. Our model allows us to calculate the
characteristic radiative timescale as a function of depth and,
by mimicking atmospheric circulation as a slow solid body
rotation, the global temperature map as a function of longitude.
We predict day-night temperature variation of about 600K at the
0.1 bar pressure level for a rotation rate of 1 km/s, in
relatively good agreement with variation of about 600K at the
0.1 bar pressure level for a rotation rate of 1 km/s, in
relatively good agreement with the predictions by Showman &
Guillot (2002).},
