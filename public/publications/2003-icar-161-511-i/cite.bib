 abstract = {We propose an interpretation of the composition of volatiles observed in
comets based on their trapping in the form of clathrate hydrates
in the solar nebula. The formation of clathrates is calculated
from the statistical thermodynamics of Lunine and Stevenson
(1985, Astrophys. J. Suppl. 58, 493-531), and occurs in an
evolutionary turbulent solar nebula described by the model of
Hersant et al. (2001, Astrophys. J. 554, 391-407). It is assumed
that clathrate hydrates were incorporated into the icy grains
that formed cometesimals. The strong depletion of the N $_2$
molecule with respect to CO observed in some comets is explained
by the fact that CO forms clathrate hydrates much more easily
than does N $_2$. The efficiency of this depletion, as well as
the amount of trapped CO, depends upon the amount of water ice
available in the region where the clathration took place. This
might explain the diversity of CO abundances observed in comets.
The same theory, applied to the trapping of volatiles around 5
AU, explains the enrichments in Ar, Kr, Xe, C, and N with
respect to the solar abundance measured in the deep troposphere
of Jupiter (Gautier et al., 2001a,b).},
