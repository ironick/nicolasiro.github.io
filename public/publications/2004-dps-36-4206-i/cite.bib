 abstract = {Charbonneau et al. (2002) conducted HST spectroscopic observations of
HD209458 centered on the sodium doublet at 589.3 nm. An
absorption feature was found, interpreted as an absorption from
the sodium in the planet's atmosphere. However, this feature is
weaker than predicted by static radiative equilibrium
atmospheric models of HD209458b. \\We
present a time-dependent radiative model of the atmosphere of
HD209458b and investigate its thermal structure and chemical
composition. Time-dependent temperature profiles are calculated,
assuming a constant-with-height zonal wind, modelled as a solid
body rotation. We predict day-night variations of the effective
temperature of \ensuremath∼600 K, for an equatorial
rotation rate of 1 km s$^-1$, in good agreement with the
predictions by Showman & Guillot, 2002. At high altitudes (mbar
pressures or less), the night temperatures are low enough to
allow sodium to condense into Na$_2$S. Synthetic transit
spectra of the visible Na doublet show a much weaker sodium
absorption on the morning limb than on the evening limb. The
calculated dimming of the sodium feature during a planetary
transit agrees with the value reported by Charbonneau et al.
(2002).},
