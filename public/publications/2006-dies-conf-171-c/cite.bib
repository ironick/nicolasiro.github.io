 abstract = {In our search for clues as to the nature of the exosphere of HD209458
(Moutou et al., 2001 ; Moutou et al., 2003, Iro et al., 2004),
we have acquired VLT/UVES data during an ambitious observational
campaign performed in June-September 2002 and covering 6
transits of the exoplanet. The resolving power was R=100000 in
the 0.475-0.68 micron range. We search for ions and neutral
molecules (such as H2O+, CO+, CH+, etc) originating in the
planets exosphere and located in the evaporated material around
the planet, occulting its primary star. We present in this paper
a tentative search in the spectral regions where features of
sodium or H_2O+̂ can be present.},
