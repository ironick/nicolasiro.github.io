 abstract = {Observations at the VLT with UVES in 2002 during 6 transits give access
to spectral regions where signatures from the atmosphere of
HD209458b may appear. We observe ON- and OFF- transit spectra
and check the differences for new absorption features. We
present in this paper a tentative search in the spectral regions
where features of sodium or H_2O+̂ can be present.},
