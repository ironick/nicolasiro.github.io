 abstract = {We analyze the thermal infrared spectra of Saturn obtained by the
Cassini-CIRS instrument to infer thermal and cloud information
for Saturn's stratosphere and upper troposphere. A narrow
spectral window centered at 1392 cm-1 allows us to probe the
structure of Saturn's atmosphere in the vicinity of the 1 bar
pressure level. Variations in the planet's emission at 1392 cm-1
indicate the presence of an atmospheric absorber that is not
uniformly distributed over the planet.
\\At the 1392 cm-1 the planet does not
exhibit the traditional well defined zone-belt structure.
Instead, in the southern hemisphere we observe a relatively
gradual change in the zonal mean brightness temperature with a
minimum at 25S and a maximum in the south polar region. The
observed variation corresponds to a zonal mean brightness
temperature change of more than 10 K. For comparision, the zone-
belt mean temperature contrast at the 1392 cm-1 is less than 3
K. In addition, the relatively cold region between 20S-55S shows
1-2 K brightness temperature variations at small zonal numbers.
\\The region south of 65S shows a
higher than expected brightness temperature indicating that in
the polar region the emission is likely to originate from a haze
layer in the warm upper stratosphere (pressure less than 10
mbar) rather than from the 1bar pressure level where clouds are
expected to form. \\We use a numerical
inversion to constrain the absorption coefficient, the optical
thickness and the pressure level of the present cloud/haze
layers in Saturn's southern hemisphere and present the results
for selected latitudes.},
