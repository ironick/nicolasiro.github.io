 abstract = {Spectra of the transiting hot Jupiter HD189733b support the possibility
that carbon and oxygen abundances range from subsolar to
oversolar in the atmosphere of the planet. Here, using a model
describing the formation sequence and composition of
planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk, we determine the range
of volatile abundances in the envelope of HD189733b that is
consistent with the 20-50 Earth-masses of heavy elements
estimated to be present in the planet's envelope. We then
compare the inferred carbon and oxygen abundances to those
retrieved from spectroscopy and we find a range of oversolar
values that directly fit both spectra and internal structure
models. In some cases, we also find that the apparent
contradiction between the subsolar elemental abundances and the
important mass of heavy elements predicted in HD189733b can be
explained by the presence of large amounts of carbon molecules
in the form of ethylene, acetylene and hydrogen cyanide that can
polymerize and form polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soots
in the upper layers of the envelope.},
