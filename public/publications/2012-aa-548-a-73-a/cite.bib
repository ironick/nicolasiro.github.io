 abstract = {We investigate the effects of atmospheric circulation on the chemistry
of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We use a simplified dynamical
model and a robust chemical network, as opposed to previous
studies, which have used a three-dimensional circulation model
coupled to a simple chemical kinetics scheme. The temperature
structure and distribution of the main atmospheric constituents
are calculated in the limit of an atmosphere that rotates as a
solid body with an equatorial rotation rate of 1 km s$^-1$.
Such motion mimics a uniform zonal wind, which resembles the
equatorial superrotation structure found by three-dimensional
circulation models. The uneven heating of this tidally locked
planet causes, even in the presence of such a strong zonal wind,
large temperature contrasts, up to 800 K, between the dayside
and nightside. This would result in important longitudinal
variations of some molecular abundances if the atmosphere were
at chemical equilibrium. The zonal wind, however, acts as a
powerful disequilibrium process. We identify the existence of a
pressure level of transition between two regimes, which may be
located between 100 and 0.1 mbar depending on the molecule.
Below this transition layer, chemical equilibrium holds. Above
it, however, the zonal wind tends to homogenise the chemical
composition of the atmosphere, bringing molecular abundances in
the limb and nightside regions close to chemical equilibrium
values characteristic of the dayside, i.e. producing a
horizontal quenching effect in the abundances. Reasoning based
on timescale arguments indicates that horizontal and vertical
mixing are likely to compete in HD 209458b's atmosphere,
producing a complex distribution where molecular abundances are
quenched horizontally to dayside values and vertically to
chemical equilibrium values characteristic of deep layers.
Either assuming pure horizontal mixing or pure vertical mixing,
we find substantial variations in the molecular abundances at
the evening and morning limbs, up to one order of magnitude for
CH$_4$. This may have consequences for the interpretation of
transmission spectra that sample the planet's terminator of hot
Jupiters.},
