 abstract = {We have developed a new model to study the atmosphere of exoplanets
adapted to the characteristics of the atmospheres of hot
Jupiters and hot Neptunes. Such a model appears essential to
interpret recent and future observations, to predict the
composition and to understand the formation and the evolution of
these planetary bodies. As the chemistry of nitrogen compounds
is not well constrained, we investigated several sub-networks
for nitrogen-bearing species and investigate their impact on the
predicted abundances and spectra of HD 189733b. We present these
results. An important problem of photochemicalmodels is the lack
of high temperature photochemical data. In order to improve this
situation, we have begun a campaign of measurement of VUV
absorption cross section at high temperature for H2O, CO2 and
NH3. We will present the influence of these new experimental
data on the thermo-photochemicalmodel.},
