 abstract = {The atmosphere of hot Jupiters can be probed by primary transit and
secondary eclipse spectroscopy. In order to constrain the
atmospheric thermal structure and composition from observables,
chemical models are necessary. Due to the intense UV
irradiation, mixing and circulation, the chemical composition is
maintained out of equilibrium and kinetic photochemical models
must be applied with kinetics valid at the high temperatures
prevailing in hot Jupiters atmospheres. We study the steady
state atmospheric composition of HD 189733b one of the most
observed hot Jupiters by implementing a new kinetic network in a
1D time-dependent chemical model including photodissociations
and vertical diffusion. We confirm that the atmospheric
composition of the planet is maintained out of the equilibrium
by photodissociations and vertical quenching. The core and
novelty of this study is the chemical scheme. It was produced in
close collaboration with experts of applied high-temperature
kinetics and methodically validated over a range of temperatures
and pressures typical of the atmospheric layers influencing the
observations of hot Jupiters. In addition to our nominal
chemical scheme, we implemented other reaction sub-networks for
nitrogen-bearing species that are commonly used in the field of
combustion, and investigate the sensitivity of the predicted
abundances and spectra to the network. We found that the
abundances of NH$_3$ and HCN can vary by 2 orders of
magnitude. A spectral feature of NH$_3$ at 10.5
\ensuremathμm is sensitive to these abundance variations
and thus to the chemical scheme.},
