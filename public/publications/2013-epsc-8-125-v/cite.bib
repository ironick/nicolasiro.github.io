 abstract = {the atmosphere of smaller planets than hot Jupiters, i.e. (sub-)Neptune
size planets. For instance, the Neptune size planet GJ 436b and
the mini Neptune or super-Earth GJ 1214b both orbiting around M
dwarf stars. These planets have interesting differences with
respect to hot Jupiters. First, because the host M dwarf star is
smaller and cooler than a solar-type star, the planet is less
severely heated, resulting in planetary effective temperatures
below 1000 K. It is interesting to note that transit spectra of
GJ 436b indicates that its atmosphere is poor in methane [1, 2,
3], yet this species is predicted to be the major carbon
reservoir at thermochemical equilibrium. Although such
interpretation has been disputed [4], if the poor methane
content of GJ 436b's atmosphere is real, there must be an
important disequilibrium process, which so far has not been
identified. A detailed chemical model by [5], considering
thermochemical kinetics, vertical mixing, and photochemistry,
concluded that CH4 should be the major carbon-bearing molecule
in GJ 436b's atmosphere under most plausible conditions. A
second important difference with respect to hot Jupiters is that
the lower mass of (sub-)Neptune planets allows to expect an
elemental atmospheric composition significantly enriched in
heavy elements, even an atmosphere not dominated by H and He but
by CO2, H2O, or some other compounds [6]. In the case of GJ
1214b, its flat transmission spectrum indicates that the planet
atmosphere either is hydrogen dominated but contains clouds or
hazes, or consists mostly of water vapour [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
The possibility of a hydrogen dominated atmosphere for GJ 1214b
has been explored through chemical modelling by [13], who found
that methane would be the major carbon reservoir, just as the
findings of [5]'s model on the atmosphere of GJ 436b, and that
photolysis of CH4, which could lead to the formation of hazes,
would take place at heights substantially higher than required
by the observations. The recent discovery of the transiting hot
Uranus GJ 3470b [14] provides a new promising candidate for
follow-up characterisation of its atmosphere and for a better
understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of (sub-)Neptunes.
Here we aim at studying its atmospheric composition through a
chemical model which considers thermochemical kinetics, vertical
mixing, and photochemistry. The chemical network has been
adapted from combustion modelling and is described in [15]. The
atmosphere model relies on some key input information such as
the elemental composition, the vertical profile of temperature
and eddy diffusion coefficient, and the stellar ultraviolet
flux, which are badly constrained. In order to explore to some
extent the sensitivity of the atmospheric chemical composition
to these uncertain parameters we have varied them around some
standard choices and computed a grid of 17 models. In most
cases, the CH4/CO ratio is above 1, as what is predicted by
chemical equilibrium. But we found that when the metallicity
increases (i.e. solar metallicity ×100) some models
lead to a CH4/CO ratio under unity. We will present you these
results, together with the corresponding synthetic spectra. This
result is very interesting because most of exoplanet atmospheres
observed so far seem to have CH4/CO ratio opposite from the
equilibrium calculation, but no chemical model succeed to find
the set of parameters that leads to this result. A very high
metallicity seems to be a solution to explore as it is very
likely for these atmospheres.},
