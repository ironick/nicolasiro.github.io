 abstract = {The dissipation of the tidal energy deposited on eccentric planets may
induce a heating of the planet that affects its atmospheric
thermal structure. Here we study the influence of tidal heating
on the atmospheric composition of the eccentric (e = 0.16) ``hot
Neptune'' GJ 436b, for which inconclusive chemical abundances
are retrieved from multiwavelength photometric observations
carried out during primary transit and secondary eclipse. We
build up a one-dimensional model of GJ 436b's atmosphere in the
vertical direction and compute the pressure-temperature and
molecular abundances profiles for various plausible internal
temperatures of the planet (up to 560 K) and metallicities (from
solar to 100 times solar), using a radiative-convective model
and a chemical model which includes thermochemical kinetics,
vertical mixing, and photochemistry. We find that the
CO/CH$_4$ abundance ratio increases with metallicity and tidal
heating, and ranges from 1/20 to 1000 within the ranges of
metallicity and internal temperature explored. Water vapor locks
most of the oxygen and reaches a very high abundance, whatever
the metallicity and internal temperature of the planet. The
CO$_2$/H$_2$O abundance ratio increases dramatically with
metallicity, and takes values between 10$^-5$-10$^-4$ with
solar elemental abundances and
åisebox-0.5ex~0.1 for a metallicity 100 times
solar. None of the atmospheric models based on solid physical
and chemical grounds provide a fully satisfactory agreement with
available observational data, although the comparison of
calculated spectra and observations seems to point to models
with a high metallicity and efficient tidal heating, in which
high CO/CH$_4$ abundance ratios and warm temperatures in the
dayside atmosphere are favored.},
