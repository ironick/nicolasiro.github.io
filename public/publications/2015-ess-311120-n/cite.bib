 abstract = {I will present one of the latest results of our GTC exoplanet transit
spectroscopy survey. Over the last years our group has obtained
ground-based optical (538 nm - 918 nm) spectrophotometric
transit observations for several hot Jupiters including
HAT-P-32Ab using the OSIRIS (Optical System for Imaging and low
Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy) instrument at the Spanish
10-meter telescope GTC.I will discuss the source, nature and
proper correction of instrument specific systematic noise we
found to affect our data. After its correction, we were able to
yield high quality results with a precision between 482 and 1703
ppm depending on the wavelength channel. We measure a flat
optical transmission spectrum for HAT-P-32Ab, consistent with
the results of Gibson et al. (2013, MNRAS, 436, 2974) obtained
with GMOS at Gemini-North. This independent reproduction of
consistent results re-establishes faith in the reliability of
ground-based transmission spectroscopy and emphasizes the high
potential of OSIRIS at the GTC as a tool to complement current
and future space-based observations.},
