 abstract = {\ Aims: We set out to study the atmosphere of WASP-80b, a
warm inflated gas giant with an equilibrium temperature of 800
K, using ground-based transmission spectroscopy covering the
spectral range from 520 to 910 nm. The observations allow us to
probe the existence and abundance of K and Na in WASP-80b's
atmosphere, existence of high-altitude clouds, and Rayleigh-
scattering in the blue end of the spectrum. \
Methods: We observed two spectroscopic time series of WASP-80b
transits with the OSIRIS spectrograph installed in the Gran
Telescopio Canarias (GTC), and use the observations to estimate
the planet's transmission spectrum between 520 nm and 910 nm in
20 nm-wide passbands, and around the K I and Na I resonance
doublets in 6 nm-wide passbands. We jointly model three
previously published broadband datasets consisting of 27 light
curves, prior to a transmission spectroscopy analysis in order
to obtain improved estimates of the planet's orbital parameters,
average radius ratio, and stellar density. The parameter
posteriors from the broadband analysis are used to set
informative priors on the transmission spectroscopy analysis.
The final transmission spectroscopy analyses are carried out
jointly for the two nights using a divide-by-white approach to
remove the common-mode systematics, and Gaussian processes to
model the residual wavelength-dependent systematics.
\ Results: We recover a flat transmission spectrum
with no evidence of Rayleigh scattering or K I or Na I
absorption, and obtain an improved system characterisation as a
by-product of the broadband- and GTC-dataset modelling. The
transmission spectra estimated separately from the two observing
runs are consistent with each other, as are the transmission
spectra estimated using either a parametric or nonparametric
systematics model. The flat transmission spectrum favours an
atmosphere model with high-altitude clouds over cloud-free
models with stellar or sub-stellar metallicities. \
Conclusions: Our results disagree with the recently published
discovery of strong K I absorption in WASP-80b's atmosphere
based on ground-based transmission spectroscopy with FORS2 at
VLT. \\The analysis code with the raw
