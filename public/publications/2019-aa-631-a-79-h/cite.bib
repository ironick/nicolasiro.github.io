 abstract = {Context. Of the presently known \ensuremath≈3900 exoplanets,
sparse spectral observations are available for
\ensuremath≈100. Ultra-hot Jupiters have recently
attracted interest from observers and theoreticians alike, as
they provide observationally accessible test cases. Confronting
detailed theoretical models with observations is of preeminent
importance in preparation for upcoming space-based telescopes.
\ Aims: We aim to study cloud formation on the
ultra-hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b, the resulting composition of the
local gas phase, and how their global changes affect wavelength-
dependent observations utilised to derive fundamental properties
of the planet. \ Methods: We apply a hierarchical
modelling approach as a virtual laboratory to study cloud
formation and gas-phase chemistry. We utilise 97 vertical 1D
profiles of a 3D GCM for HAT-P-7b to evaluate our kinetic cloud
formation model consistently with the local equilibrium gas-
phase composition. We use maps and slice views to provide a
global understanding of the cloud and gas chemistry.
\ Results: The day/night temperature difference on
HAT-P-7b (\ensuremathΔT \ensuremath≈ 2500 K)
causes clouds to form on the nightside (dominated by H$_2$/He)
while the dayside (dominated by H/He) retains cloud-free
equatorial regions. The cloud particles vary in composition and
size throughout the vertical extension of the cloud, but also
globally.
TiO$_2$[s]/Al$_2$O$_3$[s]/CaTiO$_3$[s]-particles of cm-
sized radii occur in the higher dayside-latitudes, resulting in
a dayside dominated by gas-phase opacity. The opacity on the
nightside, however, is dominated by
0.01\textellipsis0.1\ensuremathμm particles made of a
material mix dominated by silicates. The gas pressure at which
the atmosphere becomes optically thick is 10$^-4$ bar in
cloudy regions, and 0.1 bar in cloud-free regions.
\ Conclusions: HAT-P-7b features strong
morning/evening terminator asymmetries, providing an example of
patchy clouds and azimuthally-inhomogeneous chemistry. Variable
terminator properties may be accessible by ingress/egress
transmission photometry (e.g., CHEOPS and PLATO) or
spectroscopy. The large temperature differences of
\ensuremath≈2500 K result in an increasing geometrical
extension from the night- to the dayside. The H$_2$O abundance
at the terminator changes by <1 dex with altitude and
\ensuremathłesssim0.3 dex (a factor of 2) across the
terminator for a given pressure, indicating that H$_2$O
abundances derived from transmission spectra can be
representative of the well-mixed metallicity at P
\ensuremath\gtrsim 10 bar. We suggest the atmospheric C/O as
an important tool to trace the presence and location of clouds
in exoplanet atmospheres. The atmospheric C/O can be sub- and
supersolar due to cloud formation. Phase curve variability of
HAT-P-7b is unlikely to be caused by dayside clouds.},
