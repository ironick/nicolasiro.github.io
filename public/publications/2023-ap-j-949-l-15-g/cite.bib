 abstract = {Carbon monoxide (CO) is predicted to be the dominant carbon-bearing
molecule in giant planet atmospheres and, along with water, is
important for discerning the oxygen and therefore carbon-to-
oxygen ratio of these planets. The fundamental absorption mode
of CO has a broad, double-branched structure composed of many
individual absorption lines from 4.3 to 5.1 \ensuremathμm,
which can now be spectroscopically measured with JWST. Here we
present a technique for detecting the rotational sub-band
structure of CO at medium resolution with the NIRSpec G395H
instrument. We use a single transit observation of the hot
Jupiter WASP-39b from the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community
Early Release Science (JTEC ERS) program at the native
resolution of the instrument (R åisebox-0.5ex~
2700) to resolve the CO absorption structure. We robustly detect
absorption by CO, with an increase in transit depth of 264
\ensuremath± 68 ppm, in agreement with the predicted CO
contribution from the best-fit model at low resolution. This
detection confirms our theoretical expectations that CO is the
dominant carbon-bearing molecule in WASP-39b's atmosphere and
further supports the conclusions of low C/O and supersolar
metallicities presented in the JTEC ERS papers for WASP-39b.},
