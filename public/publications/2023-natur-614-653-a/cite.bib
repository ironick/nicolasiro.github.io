 abstract = {Measuring the metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio in exoplanet
atmospheres is a fundamental step towards constraining the
dominant chemical processes at work and, if in equilibrium,
revealing planet formation histories. Transmission spectroscopy
(for example, refs. $^1,2$) provides the necessary means by
constraining the abundances of oxygen- and carbon-bearing
species; however, this requires broad wavelength coverage,
moderate spectral resolution and high precision, which,
together, are not achievable with previous observatories. Now
that JWST has commenced science operations, we are able to
observe exoplanets at previously uncharted wavelengths and
spectral resolutions. Here we report time-series observations of
the transiting exoplanet WASP-39b using JWST's Near InfraRed
Camera (NIRCam). The long-wavelength spectroscopic and short-
wavelength photometric light curves span 2.0-4.0 micrometres,
exhibit minimal systematics and reveal well defined molecular
absorption features in the planet's spectrum. Specifically, we
detect gaseous water in the atmosphere and place an upper limit
on the abundance of methane. The otherwise prominent carbon
dioxide feature at 2.8 micrometres is largely masked by water.
The best-fit chemical equilibrium models favour an atmospheric
metallicity of 1-100-times solar (that is, an enrichment of
elements heavier than helium relative to the Sun) and a
substellar C/O ratio. The inferred high metallicity and low C/O
ratio may indicate significant accretion of solid materials
during planet formation (for example, refs. $^3,4$$^,$) or
disequilibrium processes in the upper atmosphere (for example,
refs. $^5,6$).},
