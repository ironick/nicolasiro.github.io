 abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy$^1-3$ of exoplanets has revealed signatures
of water vapour, aerosols and alkali metals in a few dozen
exoplanet atmospheres$^4,5$. However, these previous
inferences with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes were
hindered by the observations' relatively narrow wavelength range
and spectral resolving power, which precluded the unambiguous
identification of other chemical species—in
particular the primary carbon-bearing molecules$^6,7$. Here we
report a broad-wavelength 0.5-5.5 \textmum atmospheric
transmission spectrum of WASP-39b$^8$, a 1,200 K, roughly
Saturn-mass, Jupiter-radius exoplanet, measured with the JWST
NIRSpec's PRISM mode$^9$ as part of the JWST Transiting
Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Team
Program$^10-12$. We robustly detect several chemical species
at high significance, including Na (19\ensuremathσ),
H$_2$O (33\ensuremathσ), CO$_2$
(28\ensuremathσ) and CO (7\ensuremathσ). The
non-detection of CH$_4$, combined with a strong CO$_2$
feature, favours atmospheric models with a super-solar
atmospheric metallicity. An unanticipated absorption feature at
4 \textmum is best explained by SO$_2$
(2.7\ensuremathσ), which could be a tracer of
atmospheric photochemistry. These observations demonstrate
JWST's sensitivity to a rich diversity of exoplanet compositions
and chemical processes.},
