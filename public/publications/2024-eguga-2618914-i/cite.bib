 abstract = {With the first exoplanet JWST and Cheops data available, and ARIEL in
the near future, we are expecting to get a lot of time-varying
measurements of exoplanets (e.g. phase curves and 3D eclipse
maps), giving us unprecedented information about their climate.
Hot Jupiters will be the best targets for atmosphere
characterisation with these facilities. 3D atmospheric
circulation models are the main tools to interpret theoretically
these upcoming observations, however, it is overwhelming to
compare the numerous models developed independently with each
various assumptions and setup. Some characteristics of their
outputs are then dependent on the model used, impairing physical
interpretation. It is therefore necessary to assess the
differences, limits and applicability of each models in a
controlled manner. We present MOCHA (Modelling the Circulation
of Hot exoplanet Atmospheres), the most extensive
intercomparision of hot Jupiter 3D circulation models. Our team
is built from the experts developing all available codes, in
order to set up a common benchmark methodology.Our
intercomparison project will provide the exoplanet community
with protocols and methods to benchmark current and future 3D
models. This will lead to better and more robust tools to
retrieve physical information from JWST, Cheops, and later ARIEL
data. This project is part of CUISINES (Climates Using
Interactive Suites of Intercomparisons Nested for Exoplanet
Studies), which has already provided Model Intercomparisons
Projects (MIPS) such as THAI for the TRAPPIST planets and
CAMEMBERT for mini Neptunes.},
