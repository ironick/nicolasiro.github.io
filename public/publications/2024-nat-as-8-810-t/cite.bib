 abstract = {Ultracool dwarf stars are abundant, long-lived and uniquely suited to
enable the atmospheric study of transiting terrestrial
companions with the JWST. Among them, the most prominent is the
M8.5V star TRAPPIST-1 and its seven planets. While JWST Cycle 1
observations have started to yield preliminary insights into the
planets, they have also revealed that their atmospheric
exploration requires a better understanding of their host star.
Here we propose a roadmap to characterize the TRAPPIST-1 system
— and others like it — in an efficient
and robust manner with JWST. We notably recommend that
— although more challenging to schedule
— multi-transit windows be prioritized to mitigate
the effects of stellar activity and gather up to twice more
transits per JWST hour spent. We conclude that, for such
systems, planets cannot be studied in isolation by small
programmes but rather need large-scale, joint space- and ground-
based initiatives to fully exploit the capabilities of JWST for
the exploration of terrestrial planets.},
