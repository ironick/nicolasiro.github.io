 abstract = {Context. Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are gas giant exoplanets that are
strongly irradiated by their star, setting intense molecular
dissociation that leads to atmospheric chemistry dominated by
ions and atoms. These conditions inhibit day-to-night heat
redistribution, which results in high temperature contrasts.
Phase-curve observations over several passbands offer insights
on the thermal structure and properties of these extreme
atmospheres. Aims. We aim to perform a joint analysis of
multiple observations of WASP-18 b from the visible to the mid-
infrared, using data from CHEOPS, TESS, and Spitzer. Our purpose
is to characterise the planetary atmosphere with a consistent
view over the large wavelength range covered, including JWST
data. Methods. We implemented a model for the planetary signal
including transits, occultations, phase signal, ellipsoidal
variations, Doppler boosting, and light travel time. We
performed a joint fit of more than 250 eclipse events and
derived the atmospheric properties using general circulation
models (GCMs) and retrieval analyses. Results. We obtained new
ephemerides with unprecedented precisions of 1 second and 1.4
millisecond on the time of inferior conjunction and orbital
period, respectively. We computed a planetary radius of R $_ p
$ = 1.1926 \ensuremath± 0.0077 R $_ J $ with a
precision of 0.65% (or 550 km). Based on a timing inconsistency
with JWST, we discuss and confirm the orbital eccentricity (e =
0.00852 \ensuremath± 0.00091). We also constrain the
argument of periastron to \ensuremathømega = 261.9$_‑1.4$
$^+1.3$ deg. We show that the large dayside emission implies
the presence of magnetic drag and super-solar metallicity. We
find a steep thermally inverted gradient in the planetary
atmosphere, which is common for UHJs. We detected the presence
of strong CO emission lines at 4.5 \ensuremathμm from an
excess of dayside brightness in the Spitzer/IRAC/Channel 2
passband. Using these models to constrain the reflected
contribution in the CHEOPS passband, we derived an extremely low
geometric albedo of A$_g$ $^CHEOPS$ = 0.027
\ensuremath± 0.011. Conclusions. The orbital eccentricity
remains a potential challenge for planetary dynamics that might
require further study given the short-period massive planet and
despite the young age of the system. The characterisation of the
atmosphere of WASP-18 b reveals the necessity to account for
magnetic friction and super-solar metallicity to explain the
full picture of the dayside emission. We find the planetary
dayside to be extremely unreflective; however, when juxtaposing
TESS and CHEOPS data, we get hints of increased scattering
efficiency in the visible, likely due to Rayleigh scattering.},
