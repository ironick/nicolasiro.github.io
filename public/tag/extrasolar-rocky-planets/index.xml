      <title>The CUISINES Framework for Conducting Exoplanet Model Intercomparison Projects, Version 1.0</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As JWST begins to return observations, it is more important than ever that
exoplanet climate models can consistently and correctly predict the observability
of exoplanets, retrieval of their data, and interpretation of planetary environments
from that data. Model intercomparisons play a crucial role in this context, especially
now when few data are available to validate model predictions. The CUISINES Working
Group of NASA&amp;rsquo;s Nexus for Exoplanet Systems Science supports a systematic approach
to evaluating the performance of exoplanet models and provides here a framework
for conducting community-organized exoplanet model intercomparison projects (exoMIPs).
The CUISINES framework adapts Earth climate community practices specifically for
the needs of the exoplanet researchers, encompassing a range of model types, planetary
targets, and parameter space studies. It is intended to help researchers to work
collectively, equitably, and openly toward common goals. The CUISINES framework
rests on five principles: (1) define in advance what research question(s) the
exoMIP is intended to address, (2) create an experimental design that maximizes
community participation and advertise it widely, (3) plan a project timeline that
allows all exoMIP members to participate fully, (4) generate data products from
model output for direct comparison to observations, and (5) create a data management
plan that is workable in the present and scalable for the future. Within the first
years of its existence, CUISINES is already providing logistical support to 10
exoMIPs and will continue to host annual workshops for further community feedback
and presentation of new exoMIP ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impact of Cosmic Rays on Atmospheric Ion Chemistry and Spectral Transmission Features of TRAPPIST-1e</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/publications/2024-ap-j-961-164-h.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ongoing observing projects like the James Webb Space Telescope and future
missions offer the chance to characterize Earth-like exoplanetary atmospheres. Thereby,
M dwarfs are preferred targets for transit observations, for example, due to their
favorable planet–star contrast ratio. However, the radiation and particle environment
of these cool stars could be far more extreme than what we know from the Sun. Thus,
knowing the stellar radiation and particle environment and its possible influence
on detectable biosignatures—in particular, signs of life like ozone and methane—is
crucial to understanding upcoming transit spectra. In this study, with the help
of our unique model suite INCREASE, we investigate the impact of a strong stellar
energetic particle event on the atmospheric ionization, neutral and ion chemistry,
and atmospheric biosignatures of TRAPPIST-1e. Therefore, transit spectra for six
scenarios are simulated. We find that a Carrington-like event drastically increases
atmospheric ionization and induces substantial changes in ion chemistry and spectral
transmission features: all scenarios show high event- induced amounts of nitrogen
dioxide (i.e., at 6.2 ensuremathμm), a reduction of the atmospheric transit depth
in all water bands (i.e., at 5.5–7.0 ensuremathμm), a decrease of the methane bands
(i.e., at 3.0–3.5 ensuremathμm), and depletion of ozone (i.e., at ensuremath∼9.6
ensuremathμm). Therefore, it is essential to include high-energy particle effects
to correctly assign biosignature signals from, e.g., ozone and methane. We further
show that the nitric acid feature at 11.0–12.0 ensuremathμm, discussed as a proxy
for stellar particle contamination, is absent in wet-dead atmospheres.&lt;/p&gt;
