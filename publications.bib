     abstract = "{With JWST, observing separate spectra of the morning and evening limbs
        of hot Jupiters has finally become a reality. The first such
        observation was reported for WASP-39b, where the evening
        terminator was observed to have a larger transit radius by about
        400 ppm and a stronger 4.3 $μ$m CO$_2$ feature than the morning
        terminator. Multiple factors, including temperature differences,
        photo/thermochemistry, clouds and hazes, could cause such limb
        asymmetries. To interpret these new limb asymmetry observations,
        a detailed understanding of how the relevant processes affect
        morning and evening spectra grounded in forward models is
        needed. Focusing on WASP-39b, we compare simulations from five
        different general circulation models (GCMs), including one
        simulating disequilibrium thermochemistry and one with cloud
        radiative feedback, to the recent WASP-39b limb asymmetry
        observations. We also post-process the temperature structures of
        all simulations with a 2D photochemical model and one simulation
        with a cloud microphysics model. Although the temperatures
        predicted by the different models vary considerably, the models
        are remarkably consistent in their predicted morning--evening
        temperature differences. Several equilibrium-chemistry
        simulations predict strong methane features in the morning
        spectrum, not seen in the observations. When including
        disequilibrium processes, horizontal transport homogenizes
        methane, and these methane features disappear. However, even
        after including photochemistry and clouds, our models still
        cannot reproduce the observed ${\sim}2000$ ppm asymmetry in the
        CO$_2$ feature. A combination of factors, such as varying
        metallicity and unexplored parameters in cloud models, may
        explain the discrepancy, emphasizing the need for future models
        integrating cloud microphysics and feedback across a broader
        parameter space.}",

     abstract = "{Context. Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are gas giant exoplanets that are
        strongly irradiated by their star, setting intense molecular
        dissociation that leads to atmospheric chemistry dominated by
        ions and atoms. These conditions inhibit day-to-night heat
        redistribution, which results in high temperature contrasts.
        Phase-curve observations over several passbands offer insights
        on the thermal structure and properties of these extreme
        atmospheres. Aims. We aim to perform a joint analysis of
        multiple observations of WASP-18 b from the visible to the mid-
        infrared, using data from CHEOPS, TESS, and Spitzer. Our purpose
        is to characterise the planetary atmosphere with a consistent
        view over the large wavelength range covered, including JWST
        data. Methods. We implemented a model for the planetary signal
        including transits, occultations, phase signal, ellipsoidal
        variations, Doppler boosting, and light travel time. We
        performed a joint fit of more than 250 eclipse events and
        derived the atmospheric properties using general circulation
        models (GCMs) and retrieval analyses. Results. We obtained new
        ephemerides with unprecedented precisions of 1 second and 1.4
        millisecond on the time of inferior conjunction and orbital
        period, respectively. We computed a planetary radius of R $_{ p
        }$ = 1.1926 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0077 R $_{ J }$ with a
        precision of 0.65\% (or 550 km). Based on a timing inconsistency
        with JWST, we discuss and confirm the orbital eccentricity (e =
        0.00852 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.00091). We also constrain the
        argument of periastron to {\ensuremath{\omega}} = 261.9$_{‑1.4}$
        $^{+1.3}$ deg. We show that the large dayside emission implies
        the presence of magnetic drag and super-solar metallicity. We
        find a steep thermally inverted gradient in the planetary
        atmosphere, which is common for UHJs. We detected the presence
        of strong CO emission lines at 4.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m from an
        excess of dayside brightness in the Spitzer/IRAC/Channel 2
        passband. Using these models to constrain the reflected
        contribution in the CHEOPS passband, we derived an extremely low
        geometric albedo of A$_{g}$ $^{CHEOPS}$ = 0.027
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.011. Conclusions. The orbital eccentricity
        remains a potential challenge for planetary dynamics that might
        require further study given the short-period massive planet and
        despite the young age of the system. The characterisation of the
        atmosphere of WASP-18 b reveals the necessity to account for
        magnetic friction and super-solar metallicity to explain the
        full picture of the dayside emission. We find the planetary
        dayside to be extremely unreflective; however, when juxtaposing
        TESS and CHEOPS data, we get hints of increased scattering
        efficiency in the visible, likely due to Rayleigh scattering.}",

        planets up to intermediate orbital periods, relevant for a
        meaningful comparison to planet formation theories and to better
        understand planet evolution. It will make possible comparative

        weathering and thereby extends the potential habitable timespan

        the runaway greenhouse on Earth-like exoplanets is generally
        accompanied by a dramatic increase in atmospheric H$_{2}$O and
        CO$_{2}$, which might be observed with the upcoming generation
        of space telescopes. If an active biosphere extends the
        habitable timespan of exoplanets similarly to Earth, observing
        the atmospheric spectra of exoplanets near the inner edge of the
        habitable zone could then give insights into whether the planet
        is inhabited. Here, we explore this idea for Earth-like
        stagnant-lid planets. We find that while for a reduced mantle, a
        surface biosphere extends the habitable timespan of the planet
        by about 1 Gyr, for more oxidising conditions, the biologically
        enhanced rate of weathering becomes increasingly compensated for
        by an increased supply rate of CO$_{2}$ to the atmosphere.
        Observationally, the resulting difference in atmospheric
        CO$_{2}$ near the inner edge of the habitable zone is clearly
        distinguishable between biotic planets with active weathering
        and abiotic planets that have experienced a runaway greenhouse.
        For an efficient hydrological cycle, the increased
        bioproductivity also leads to a CH$_{4}$ biosignature observable
        with JWST. As the planet becomes uninhabitable, the H$_{2}$O
        infrared absorption bands dominate, but the 4.3-{\textmu}m
        CO$_{2}$ band remains a clear window into the CO$_{2}$
        abundances. In summary, while the effect of life on the
        carbonate-silicate cycle leaves a record in the atmospheric
        spectrum of Earth-like stagnant-lid planets, future work is
        needed especially to determine the tectonic state and
        composition of exoplanets and to push forward the development of
        the next generation of space telescopes.}",

        that exoplanet climate models can consistently and correctly
        predict the observability of exoplanets, retrieval of their
        data, and interpretation of planetary environments from that
        data. Model intercomparisons play a crucial role in this
        context, especially now when few data are available to validate
        model predictions. The CUISINES Working Group of NASA's Nexus
        for Exoplanet Systems Science supports a systematic approach to
        evaluating the performance of exoplanet models and provides here
        a framework for conducting community-organized exoplanet model
        intercomparison projects (exoMIPs). The CUISINES framework
        adapts Earth climate community practices specifically for the
        needs of the exoplanet researchers, encompassing a range of
        model types, planetary targets, and parameter space studies. It
        is intended to help researchers to work collectively, equitably,
        and openly toward common goals. The CUISINES framework rests on
        five principles: (1) define in advance what research question(s)
        the exoMIP is intended to address, (2) create an experimental
        design that maximizes community participation and advertise it
        widely, (3) plan a project timeline that allows all exoMIP
        members to participate fully, (4) generate data products from
        model output for direct comparison to observations, and (5)
        create a data management plan that is workable in the present

        poorly understood how their chemical composition and cloud
        properties vary with longitude. Theoretical models predict that
        clouds may condense on the nightside and that molecular
        abundances can be driven out of equilibrium by zonal winds. Here
        we report a phase-resolved emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter
        WASP-43b measured from 5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m to 12
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m with the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument. The
        spectra reveal a large day-night temperature contrast (with
        average brightness temperatures of 1,524 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 35 K
        and 863 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 23 K, respectively) and evidence for
        water absorption at all orbital phases. Comparisons with three-
        dimensional atmospheric models show that both the phase-curve
        shape and emission spectra strongly suggest the presence of
        nightside clouds that become optically thick to thermal emission
        at pressures greater than \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde100
        mbar. The dayside is consistent with a cloudless atmosphere
        above the mid-infrared photosphere. Contrary to expectations
        from equilibrium chemistry but consistent with disequilibrium
        kinetics models, methane is not detected on the nightside
        (2{\ensuremath{\sigma}} upper limit of 1-6 ppm, depending on
        model assumptions). Our results provide strong evidence that the
        atmosphere of WASP-43b is shaped by disequilibrium processes and
        provide new insights into the properties of the planet's
        nightside clouds. However, the remaining discrepancies between
        our observations and our predictive atmospheric models emphasize
        the importance of further exploring the effects of clouds and

        enable the atmospheric study of transiting terrestrial

        from near-infrared JWST observations$^{1-3}$ suggests that
        photochemistry is a key process in high-temperature exoplanet
        atmospheres$^{4}$. This is because of the low (<1 ppb) abundance
        of SO$_{2}$ under thermochemical equilibrium compared with that
        produced from the photochemistry of H$_{2}$O and H$_{2}$S (1-10
        ppm)$^{4-9}$. However, the SO$_{2}$ inference was made from a
        single, small molecular feature in the transmission spectrum of
        WASP-39b at 4.05 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m and, therefore, the
        detection of other SO$_{2}$ absorption bands at different
        wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO$_{2}$
        abundance. Here we report the detection of SO$_{2}$ spectral

        SO$_{2}$, we find broad water-vapour absorption features, as
        well as an unexplained decrease in the transit depth at
        wavelengths longer than 10 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m. Fitting the
        spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward models, we derive an
        atmospheric heavy-element content (metallicity) for WASP-39b of

        exoplanetary atmospheres. Thereby, M dwarfs are preferred
        targets for transit observations, for example, due to their
        favorable planet{\textendash}star contrast ratio. However, the
        radiation and particle environment of these cool stars could be
        far more extreme than what we know from the Sun. Thus, knowing

        influence on detectable biosignatures{\textemdash}in particular,
        signs of life like ozone and methane{\textemdash}is crucial to
        understanding upcoming transit spectra. In this study, with the

        impact of a strong stellar energetic particle event on the
        atmospheric ionization, neutral and ion chemistry, and
        atmospheric biosignatures of TRAPPIST-1e. Therefore, transit
        spectra for six scenarios are simulated. We find that a
        Carrington-like event drastically increases atmospheric
        ionization and induces substantial changes in ion chemistry and
        spectral transmission features: all scenarios show high event-
        induced amounts of nitrogen dioxide (i.e., at 6.2

        depth in all water bands (i.e., at 5.5{\textendash}7.0

        Therefore, it is essential to include high-energy particle
        effects to correctly assign biosignature signals from, e.g.,
        ozone and methane. We further show that the nitric acid feature

        is considered a crucial avenue for unlocking the formation and
        evolution of exoplanetary systems$^{1,2}$. Access to the
        chemical inventory of an exoplanet requires high-precision
        observations, often inferred from individual molecular
        detections with low-resolution space-based$^{3-5}$ and high-
        resolution ground-based$^{6-8}$ facilities. Here we report the
        medium-resolution (R {\ensuremath{\approx}} 600) transmission
        spectrum of an exoplanet atmosphere between 3 and 5
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m covering several absorption features for the
        Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b (ref. $^{9}$), obtained with the
        Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) G395H grating of JWST. Our
        observations achieve 1.46 times photon precision, providing an
        average transit depth uncertainty of 221 ppm per spectroscopic
        bin, and present minimal impacts from systematic effects. We
        detect significant absorption from CO$_{2}$
        (28.5{\ensuremath{\sigma}}) and H$_{2}$O
        (21.5{\ensuremath{\sigma}}), and identify SO$_{2}$ as the source
        of absorption at 4.1 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m
        (4.8{\ensuremath{\sigma}}). Best-fit atmospheric models range
        between 3 and 10 times solar metallicity, with sub-solar to
        solar C/O ratios. These results, including the detection of
        SO$_{2}$, underscore the importance of characterizing the
        chemistry in exoplanet atmospheres and showcase NIRSpec G395H as
        an excellent mode for time-series observations over this

        atmospheres is a fundamental step towards constraining the
        dominant chemical processes at work and, if in equilibrium,
        revealing planet formation histories. Transmission spectroscopy
        (for example, refs. $^{1,2}$) provides the necessary means by
        constraining the abundances of oxygen- and carbon-bearing
        species; however, this requires broad wavelength coverage,
        moderate spectral resolution and high precision, which,
        together, are not achievable with previous observatories. Now
        that JWST has commenced science operations, we are able to
        observe exoplanets at previously uncharted wavelengths and
        spectral resolutions. Here we report time-series observations of
        the transiting exoplanet WASP-39b using JWST's Near InfraRed
        Camera (NIRCam). The long-wavelength spectroscopic and short-
        wavelength photometric light curves span 2.0-4.0 micrometres,
        exhibit minimal systematics and reveal well defined molecular
        absorption features in the planet's spectrum. Specifically, we
        detect gaseous water in the atmosphere and place an upper limit
        on the abundance of methane. The otherwise prominent carbon
        dioxide feature at 2.8 micrometres is largely masked by water.
        The best-fit chemical equilibrium models favour an atmospheric
        metallicity of 1-100-times solar (that is, an enrichment of
        elements heavier than helium relative to the Sun) and a
        substellar C/O ratio. The inferred high metallicity and low C/O
        ratio may indicate significant accretion of solid materials

        present the detection of CO$_{2}$ in the atmosphere of the gas
        giant exoplanet WASP-39b from transmission spectroscopy
        observations obtained with JWST as part of the Early Release
        Science programme$^{13,14}$. The data used in this study span
        3.0-5.5 micrometres in wavelength and show a prominent CO$_{2}$
        absorption feature at 4.3 micrometres (26-sigma significance).
        The overall spectrum is well matched by one-dimensional, ten-
        times solar metallicity models that assume radiative-convective-
        thermochemical equilibrium and have moderate cloud opacity.
        These models predict that the atmosphere should have water,
        carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide in addition to CO$_{2}$,
        but little methane. Furthermore, we also tentatively detect a
        small absorption feature near 4.0 micrometres that is not
        reproduced by these models.}",

     abstract = "{Context. Ultra-hot Jupiters are the hottest exoplanets that have been
        discovered so far. They present a unique possibility to explore
        hot and cold chemistry on one object. The tidally locked ultra-
        hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b has a day-to-night temperature difference
        of ≃2500 K, confining cloud formation to the nightside and
        efficient ionisation to the dayside. Both have distinct
        observational signatures. \textbackslash Aims: We analyse plasma
        and magnetic processes in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot
        Jupiter HAT-P-7b to investigate the formation of an ionosphere
        and the possibility of magnetically coupling the atmospheric gas
        as the base for an extended exosphere. We show which ions and
        atoms may be used as spectral tracers, and if and where
        conditions for lightning may occur within the clouds of
        HAT-P-7b. \textbackslash Methods: We used 3D modelling results
        as input for a kinetic cloud formation code and evaluated
        characteristic plasma and magnetic coupling parameters. A local
        thermodynamical equilibrium radiative transfer was solved for
        the ionised gas phase. This study is confined to thermal
        ionisation only. \textbackslash Results: The ionisation
        throughout HAT-P-7b's atmosphere varies drastically between day-
        and nightside. The dayside has high levels of thermal ionisation
        and long-range electromagnetic interactions dominate over
        kinetic electron-neutral interactions, suggesting a day-night
        difference in magnetic coupling. K$^{+}$, Na$^{+}$, Li$^{+}$,
        Ca$^{+}$, and Al$^{+}$ are more abundant than their atomic
        counterparts on the dayside. The minimum magnetic flux density
        for electrons for magnetic coupling is B < 0.5 G for all regions
        of HAT-P-7b's atmosphere. \textbackslash Conclusions: HAT-P-7b's
        dayside has an asymmetric ionosphere that extends deep into the
        atmosphere, the nightside has no thermally driven ionosphere. A
        corresponding asymmetry is imprinted in the ion and neutral
        composition at the terminators. The ionosphere on HAT-P-7b may
        be directly traced by the Ca$^{+}$ H\&K lines if the local
        temperature is {\ensuremath{\geq}}5000 K. The whole atmosphere
        may couple to a global, large-scale magnetic field, and
        lightning may occur on the nightside.}",

        commonly considered to be at thermochemical equilibrium. We aim
        to provide disequilibrium chemistry maps for a global
        understanding of the chemistry in the atmosphere of HAT-P-7b and
        assess the importance of disequilibrium chemistry on UHJs.
        \textbackslash Methods: We applied a hierarchical modeling
        approach using 97 1D atmospheric profiles from a 3D general
        circulation model of HAT-P-7b. For each atmospheric 1D profile,
        we evaluated our kinetic cloud formation model consistently with
        the local gas-phase composition in chemical equilibrium. This
        served as input to study the quenching of dominating CHNO-
        binding molecules. We evaluated quenching results from a zeroth-
        order approximation in comparison to a kinetic gas-phase
        approach. \textbackslash Results: We find that the zeroth-order
        approach of estimating quenching points agrees well with the
        full gas-kinetic modeling results. However, it underestimates
        the quenching levels by about one order of magnitude at high
        temperatures. Chemical disequilibrium has the greatest effect on
        the nightside and morning abundance of species such as H,
        H$_{2}$O, CH$_{4}$, CO$_{2}$, HCN, and all C$_{n}$H$_{m}$
        molecules; heavier C$_{n}$H$_{m}$ molecules are more affected by
        disequilibrium processes. The CO abundance, however, is affected
        only marginally. While dayside abundances also notably change,
        those around the evening terminator of HAT-P-7b are the least
        affected by disequilibrium processes. The latter finding may
        partially explain the consistency of observed transmission
        spectra of UHJs with atmospheres in thermochemical equilibrium.
        Photochemistry only negligibly affects molecular abundances and
        quenching levels. \textbackslash Conclusions: In general, the
        quenching points of the atmosphere of HAT-P-7b are at much lower
        pressures than in the cooler hot-jupiters. We propose several
        avenues to determining the effect of disequilibrium processes on
        UHJs that are in general based on abundance and opacity
        measurements at different local times. It remains a challenge to
        completely disentangle this from the chemical effects of clouds
        and that of a primordial nonsolar abundance.}",

        sparse spectral observations are available for
        {\ensuremath{\approx}}100. Ultra-hot Jupiters have recently
        attracted interest from observers and theoreticians alike, as
        they provide observationally accessible test cases. Confronting
        detailed theoretical models with observations is of preeminent
        importance in preparation for upcoming space-based telescopes.
        \textbackslash Aims: We aim to study cloud formation on the
        ultra-hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b, the resulting composition of the
        local gas phase, and how their global changes affect wavelength-
        dependent observations utilised to derive fundamental properties
        of the planet. \textbackslash Methods: We apply a hierarchical
        modelling approach as a virtual laboratory to study cloud
        formation and gas-phase chemistry. We utilise 97 vertical 1D
        profiles of a 3D GCM for HAT-P-7b to evaluate our kinetic cloud
        formation model consistently with the local equilibrium gas-
        phase composition. We use maps and slice views to provide a
        global understanding of the cloud and gas chemistry.
        \textbackslash Results: The day/night temperature difference on
        HAT-P-7b ({\ensuremath{\Delta}}T {\ensuremath{\approx}} 2500 K)
        causes clouds to form on the nightside (dominated by H$_{2}$/He)
        while the dayside (dominated by H/He) retains cloud-free
        equatorial regions. The cloud particles vary in composition and
        size throughout the vertical extension of the cloud, but also
        globally.
        TiO$_{2}$[s]/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$[s]/CaTiO$_{3}$[s]-particles of cm-
        sized radii occur in the higher dayside-latitudes, resulting in
        a dayside dominated by gas-phase opacity. The opacity on the
        nightside, however, is dominated by
        0.01{\textellipsis}0.1{\ensuremath{\mu}}m particles made of a
        material mix dominated by silicates. The gas pressure at which
        the atmosphere becomes optically thick is 10$^{-4}$ bar in
        cloudy regions, and 0.1 bar in cloud-free regions.
        \textbackslash Conclusions: HAT-P-7b features strong
        morning/evening terminator asymmetries, providing an example of
        patchy clouds and azimuthally-inhomogeneous chemistry. Variable
        terminator properties may be accessible by ingress/egress
        transmission photometry (e.g., CHEOPS and PLATO) or
        spectroscopy. The large temperature differences of
        {\ensuremath{\approx}}2500 K result in an increasing geometrical
        extension from the night- to the dayside. The H$_{2}$O abundance
        at the terminator changes by <1 dex with altitude and
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}0.3 dex (a factor of 2) across the
        terminator for a given pressure, indicating that H$_{2}$O
        abundances derived from transmission spectra can be
        representative of the well-mixed metallicity at P
        {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 10 bar. We suggest the atmospheric C/O as
        an important tool to trace the presence and location of clouds
        in exoplanet atmospheres. The atmospheric C/O can be sub- and
        supersolar due to cloud formation. Phase curve variability of
        HAT-P-7b is unlikely to be caused by dayside clouds.}",

        transform our understanding of planets and the origins of life

        However, the high-precision, timeseries observations required
        for such investigations have unique technical challenges, and
        prior experience with Hubble, Spitzer, and other facilities
        indicates that there will be a steep learning curve when JWST
        becomes operational. In this paper, we describe the science
        objectives and detailed plans of the Transiting Exoplanet
        Community Early Release Science (ERS) Program, which is a
        recently approved program for JWST observations early in Cycle
        1. We also describe the simulations used to establish the
        program. The goal of this project, for which the obtained data
        will have no exclusive access period, is to accelerate the
        acquisition and diffusion of technical expertise for transiting
        exoplanet observations with JWST, while also providing a
        compelling set of representative data sets that will enable
        immediate scientific breakthroughs. The Transiting Exoplanet
        Community ERS Program will exercise the timeseries modes of all

        highest priorities, observe the full suite of transiting planet
        characterization geometries (transits, eclipses, and phase
        curves), and target planets with host stars that span an
        illustrative range of brightnesses. The observations in this
        program were defined through an inclusive and transparent
        process that had participation from JWST instrument experts and
        international leaders in transiting exoplanet studies. The
        targets have been vetted with previous measurements, will be
        observable early in the mission, and have exceptional scientific
        merit. Community engagement in the project will be centered on a
        two-phase Data Challenge that culminates with the delivery of
        planetary spectra, timeseries instrument performance reports,
        and open-source data analysis toolkits in time to inform the

     abstract = "{Thousands of exoplanets have now been discovered with a huge range of
        masses, sizes and orbits: from rocky Earth-like planets to large
        gas giants grazing the surface of their host star. However, the
        essential nature of these exoplanets remains largely mysterious:
        there is no known, discernible pattern linking the presence,
        size, or orbital parameters of a planet to the nature of its
        parent star. We have little idea whether the chemistry of a
        planet is linked to its formation environment, or whether the
        type of host star drives the physics and chemistry of the
        planet's birth, and evolution. ARIEL was conceived to observe a
        large number ( 1000) of transiting planets for statistical
        understanding, including gas giants, Neptunes, super-Earths and
        Earth-size planets around a range of host star types using
        transit spectroscopy in the 1.25-7.8 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m
        spectral range and multiple narrow-band photometry in the
        optical. ARIEL will focus on warm and hot planets to take
        advantage of their well-mixed atmospheres which should show
        minimal condensation and sequestration of high-Z materials
        compared to their colder Solar System siblings. Said warm and
        hot atmospheres are expected to be more representative of the
        planetary bulk composition. Observations of these warm/hot
        exoplanets, and in particular of their elemental composition
        (especially C, O, N, S, Si), will allow the understanding of the
        early stages of planetary and atmospheric formation during the
        nebular phase and the following few million years. ARIEL will
        thus provide a representative picture of the chemical nature of
        the exoplanets and relate this directly to the type and chemical
        environment of the host star. ARIEL is designed as a dedicated
        survey mission for combined-light spectroscopy, capable of
        observing a large and well-defined planet sample within its
        4-year mission lifetime. Transit, eclipse and phase-curve
        spectroscopy methods, whereby the signal from the star and
        planet are differentiated using knowledge of the planetary
        ephemerides, allow us to measure atmospheric signals from the
        planet at levels of 10-100 part per million (ppm) relative to
        the star and, given the bright nature of targets, also allows
        more sophisticated techniques, such as eclipse mapping, to give
        a deeper insight into the nature of the atmosphere. These types
        of observations require a stable payload and satellite platform
        with broad, instantaneous wavelength coverage to detect many
        molecular species, probe the thermal structure, identify clouds
        and monitor the stellar activity. The wavelength range proposed
        covers all the expected major atmospheric gases from e.g.
        H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$, CH$_{4}$ NH$_{3}$, HCN, H$_{2}$S through to
        the more exotic metallic compounds, such as TiO, VO, and
        condensed species. Simulations of ARIEL performance in
        conducting exoplanet surveys have been performed - using
        conservative estimates of mission performance and a full model
        of all significant noise sources in the measurement - using a
        list of potential ARIEL targets that incorporates the latest
        available exoplanet statistics. The conclusion at the end of the
        Phase A study, is that ARIEL - in line with the stated mission
        objectives - will be able to observe about 1000 exoplanets
        depending on the details of the adopted survey strategy, thus
        confirming the feasibility of the main science objectives.}",

     abstract = "{\textbackslash Aims: We set out to study the atmosphere of WASP-80b, a
        warm inflated gas giant with an equilibrium temperature of 800
        K, using ground-based transmission spectroscopy covering the
        spectral range from 520 to 910 nm. The observations allow us to
        probe the existence and abundance of K and Na in WASP-80b's
        atmosphere, existence of high-altitude clouds, and Rayleigh-
        scattering in the blue end of the spectrum. \textbackslash
        Methods: We observed two spectroscopic time series of WASP-80b
        transits with the OSIRIS spectrograph installed in the Gran
        Telescopio Canarias (GTC), and use the observations to estimate
        the planet's transmission spectrum between 520 nm and 910 nm in
        20 nm-wide passbands, and around the K I and Na I resonance
        doublets in 6 nm-wide passbands. We jointly model three
        previously published broadband datasets consisting of 27 light
        curves, prior to a transmission spectroscopy analysis in order
        to obtain improved estimates of the planet's orbital parameters,
        average radius ratio, and stellar density. The parameter
        posteriors from the broadband analysis are used to set
        informative priors on the transmission spectroscopy analysis.
        The final transmission spectroscopy analyses are carried out
        jointly for the two nights using a divide-by-white approach to
        remove the common-mode systematics, and Gaussian processes to
        model the residual wavelength-dependent systematics.
        \textbackslash Results: We recover a flat transmission spectrum
        with no evidence of Rayleigh scattering or K I or Na I
        absorption, and obtain an improved system characterisation as a
        by-product of the broadband- and GTC-dataset modelling. The
        transmission spectra estimated separately from the two observing
        runs are consistent with each other, as are the transmission
        spectra estimated using either a parametric or nonparametric
        systematics model. The flat transmission spectrum favours an
        atmosphere model with high-altitude clouds over cloud-free
        models with stellar or sub-stellar metallicities. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: Our results disagree with the recently published
        discovery of strong K I absorption in WASP-80b's atmosphere
        based on ground-based transmission spectroscopy with FORS2 at
        VLT. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe analysis code with the raw

        characterizing the atmospheres of extrasolar planets under very
        different conditions from those found in our solar system.
        \textbackslash Aims: We are currently carrying out a ground-
        based survey to obtain the transmission spectra of several
        extrasolar planets using the 10 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. In
        this paper we investigate the extrasolar planet WASP-48b, a hot
        Jupiter orbiting around an F-type star with a period of 2.14
        days. \textbackslash Methods: We obtained long-slit optical
        spectroscopy of one transit of WASP-48b with the Optical System
        for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated
        Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) spectrograph. We integrated the spectrum
        of WASP-48 and one reference star in several channels with
        different wavelength ranges, creating numerous color light
        curves of the transit. We fit analytic transit curves to the
        data taking into account the systematic effects present in the
        time series in an effort to measure the change of the planet-to-
        star radius ratio (R$_{p}$/R$_{s}$) across wavelength. The
        change in transit depth can be compared with atmosphere models
        to infer the presence of particular atomic or molecular
        compounds in the atmosphere of WASP-48b. \textbackslash Results:
        After removing the transit model and systematic trends to the
        curves we reached precisions between 261 ppm and 455-755 ppm for
        the white and spectroscopic light curves, respectively. We
        obtained R$_{p}$/R$_{s}$ uncertainty values between 0.8
        {\texttimes} 10$^{-3}$ and 1.5 {\texttimes} 10$^{-3}$ for all
        the curves analyzed in this work. The measured transit depth for
        the curves made by integrating the wavelength range between 530
        nm and 905 nm is in agreement with previous studies. We report a
        relatively flat transmission spectrum for WASP-48b with no
        statistical significant detection of atmospheric species,
        although the theoretical models that fit the data more closely
        include TiO and VO. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe transit

        measuring the wavelength-dependent, planet-to-star radius ratios
        in the region between 518-918 nm. We used the OSIRIS instrument
        at the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) in long-slit spectroscopy
        mode, placing <ASTROBJ>HAT-P-32</ASTROBJ> and a reference star
        in the same slit and obtaining a time series of spectra covering
        two transit events. Using the best quality data set, we were
        able to yield 20 narrowband transit light curves, with each
        passband spanning a 20 nm wide interval. After removal of all
        systematic noise signals and light curve modeling, the
        uncertainties for the resulting radius ratios lie between 337
        and 972 ppm. The radius ratios show little variation with
        wavelength, suggesting a high altitude cloud layer masking any
        atmospheric features. Alternatively, a strong depletion in
        alkali metals or a much smaller than expected planetary
        atmospheric scale height could be responsible for the lack of
        atmospheric features. Our result of a flat transmission spectrum
        is consistent with a previous ground-based study of the optical
        spectrum of this planet. This agreement between independent
        results demonstrates that ground-based measurements of exoplanet
        atmospheres can give reliable and reproducible results despite
        the fact that the data often is heavily affected by systematic
        noise as long as the noise source is well understood and
        properly corrected. We also extract an optical spectrum of the
        M-dwarf companion HAT-P-32B. Using PHOENIX stellar atmosphere
        models we determine an effective temperature of T$_{eff}$ =
        3187$^{+60}$$_{-71}$ K, which is slightly colder than previous

        identified in the light curves the mission obtained in summer
        2011, and presented an asymmetric transit light curve, which was
        tentatively explained via the effects of gravity darkening.
        \textbackslash Aims: Transits of CoRoT-29b are measured with
        precision photometry, to characterize the reported asymmetry in
        their transit shape. \textbackslash Methods: Using the OSIRIS
        spectrograph at the 10-m GTC telescope, we perform spectro-
        photometric differential observations, which allow us to both
        calculate a high-accuracy photometric light curve, and a study
        of the color-dependence of the transit. \textbackslash Results:
        After careful data analysis, we find that the previously
        reported asymmetry is not present in either of two transits,
        observed in July 2014 and July 2015 with high photometric
        precisions of 300 ppm over 5 min. Due to the relative faintness
        of the star, we do not reach the precision necessary to perform
        transmission spectroscopy of its atmosphere, but we see no signs
        of color-dependency of the transit depth or duration.
        \textbackslash Conclusions: We conclude that the previously
        reported asymmetry may have been a time-dependent phenomenon,
        which did not occur in more recent epochs. Alternatively,
        instrumental effects in the discovery data may need to be
        reconsidered. \textbackslash\textbackslashLight curves are only

        analysis is based on a Bayesian approach where the light curves
        covering a set of given passbands are fitted jointly with
        PHOENIX-calculated stellar limb darkening profiles. The analysis
        is carried out assuming both white and red noise that is
        temporally correlated, with two approaches (Gaussian processes
        and divide-by-white) to account for the red noise.
        \textbackslash Results: An initial analysis reveals a
        transmission spectrum that shows a strong Rayleigh-like increase
        in extinction towards the blue end of the spectrum, and enhanced
        extinction around the K I resonance doublet near 767 nm.
        However, the signal amplitudes are significantly larger than
        expected from theoretical considerations. A detailed analysis
        reveals that the K I-like feature is entirely due to variability
        in the telluric O$_{2}$ absorption, but the Rayleigh-like

     abstract = "{The discovery of almost two thousand exoplanets has revealed an
        unexpectedly diverse planet population. We see gas giants in
        few-day orbits, whole multi-planet systems within the orbit of
        Mercury, and new populations of planets with masses between that
        of the Earth and Neptune{\textemdash}all unknown in the Solar
        System. Observations to date have shown that our Solar System is
        certainly not representative of the general population of
        planets in our Milky Way. The key science questions that
        urgently need addressing are therefore: What are exoplanets made
        of? Why are planets as they are? How do planetary systems work
        and what causes the exceptional diversity observed as compared
        to the Solar System? The EChO (Exoplanet Characterisation
        Observatory) space mission was conceived to take up the
        challenge to explain this diversity in terms of formation,
        evolution, internal structure and planet and atmospheric
        composition. This requires in-depth spectroscopic knowledge of
        the atmospheres of a large and well-defined planet sample for
        which precise physical, chemical and dynamical information can
        be obtained. In order to fulfil this ambitious scientific
        program, EChO was designed as a dedicated survey mission for
        transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable of observing a large,
        diverse and well-defined planet sample within its 4-year mission
        lifetime. The transit and eclipse spectroscopy method, whereby
        the signal from the star and planet are differentiated using
        knowledge of the planetary ephemerides, allows us to measure
        atmospheric signals from the planet at levels of at least
        10$^{-4}$ relative to the star. This can only be achieved in
        conjunction with a carefully designed stable payload and
        satellite platform. It is also necessary to provide broad
        instantaneous wavelength coverage to detect as many molecular
        species as possible, to probe the thermal structure of the
        planetary atmospheres and to correct for the contaminating
        effects of the stellar photosphere. This requires wavelength
        coverage of at least 0.55 to 11 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m with a goal
        of covering from 0.4 to 16 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m. Only modest
        spectral resolving power is needed, with R
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 300 for wavelengths less than 5
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m and R \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 30
        for wavelengths greater than this. The transit spectroscopy
        technique means that no spatial resolution is required. A
        telescope collecting area of about 1 m$^{2}$ is sufficiently
        large to achieve the necessary spectro-photometric precision:
        for the Phase A study a 1.13 m$^{2}$ telescope, diffraction
        limited at 3 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m has been adopted. Placing the
        satellite at L2 provides a cold and stable thermal environment
        as well as a large field of regard to allow efficient time-
        critical observation of targets randomly distributed over the
        sky. EChO has been conceived to achieve a single goal: exoplanet
        spectroscopy. The spectral coverage and signal-to-noise to be
        achieved by EChO, thanks to its high stability and dedicated
        design, would be a game changer by allowing atmospheric
        composition to be measured with unparalleled exactness: at least
        a factor 10 more precise and a factor 10 to 1000 more accurate
        than current observations. This would enable the detection of
        molecular abundances three orders of magnitude lower than
        currently possible and a fourfold increase from the handful of
        molecules detected to date. Combining these data with estimates
        of planetary bulk compositions from accurate measurements of
        their radii and masses would allow degeneracies associated with
        planetary interior modelling to be broken, giving unique insight
        into the interior structure and elemental abundances of these
        alien worlds. EChO would allow scientists to study exoplanets
        both as a population and as individuals. The mission can target
        super-Earths, Neptune-like, and Jupiter-like planets, in the
        very hot to temperate zones (planet temperatures of 300-3000 K)
        of F to M-type host stars. The EChO core science would be
        delivered by a three-tier survey. The EChO Chemical Census: This
        is a broad survey of a few-hundred exoplanets, which allows us
        to explore the spectroscopic and chemical diversity of the
        exoplanet population as a whole. The EChO Origin: This is a deep
        survey of a subsample of tens of exoplanets for which
        significantly higher signal to noise and spectral resolution
        spectra can be obtained to explain the origin of the exoplanet
        diversity (such as formation mechanisms, chemical processes,
        atmospheric escape). The EChO Rosetta Stones: This is an ultra-
        high accuracy survey targeting a subsample of select exoplanets.
        These will be the bright ``benchmark'' cases for which a large
        number of measurements would be taken to explore temporal
        variations, and to obtain two and three dimensional spatial
        information on the atmospheric conditions through eclipse-
        mapping techniques. If EChO were launched today, the exoplanets
        currently observed are sufficient to provide a large and diverse
        sample. The Chemical Census survey would consist of > 160
        exoplanets with a range of planetary sizes, temperatures,
        orbital parameters and stellar host properties. Additionally,
        over the next 10 years, several new ground- and space-based
        transit photometric surveys and missions will come on-line (e.g.
        NGTS, CHEOPS, TESS, PLATO), which will specifically focus on
        finding bright, nearby systems. The current rapid rate of
        discovery would allow the target list to be further optimised in
        the years prior to EChO's launch and enable the atmospheric
        characterisation of hundreds of planets.}",

        Our measurements imply an average planet to star radius ratio
        equal to R$_{p}$/R$_{*}$ = (0.1159 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0005).
        This result is consistent with the value obtained from recent
        near-infrared measurements of this object, but differs from
        previously reported optical measurements, being lower by around
        4.4 exoplanet scale heights. Analyzing the data over five
        different spectral bins of {\ensuremath{\sim}}600 {\r{A}} wide,
        we observed a single peaked spectrum (3.7 {\ensuremath{\sigma}}

        atmospheres of a handful of transiting planets, because most

        orbiting the brightest stars, enabling, in principle, an
        atmospheric survey of 10\^2 to 10\^3 bright hot Jupiters and
        warm sub-Neptunes. Uniform observations of such a statistically
        significant sample would provide leverage to understand---and
        learn from---the diversity of short-period planets. We argue

        10\^3 transits per year, thus enabling it to survey a large
        fraction of the bright (J<11) TESS planets. JWST could be used
        to perform detailed atmospheric characterization of the most
        interesting transiting targets (transit, eclipse, and---when
        possible---phase-resolved spectroscopy). TESS is also expected
        to discover a few temperate terrestrial planets transiting

        intensive: JWST will need months to provide tantalizing
        constraints on the presence of an atmosphere, planetary
        rotational state, clouds, and greenhouse gases. Future flagship

        of some giant exoplanets and get some clues about their
        atmospheric composition. However, the chemical compositions
        derived from observations are not fully understood. For
        instance, the CH$_{4}$/CO abundance ratio is often inferred to
        be different from the value that has been predicted by chemical
        models. Recently, the warm Neptune GJ 3470b has been discovered,
        and because of its close distance from us and high transit
        depth, it is a very promising candidate for follow-up
        characterisation of its atmosphere. \textbackslash Aims: We
        study the atmospheric composition of GJ 3470b to compare to the
        current observations of this planet and to prepare for future
        ones but also to understand the chemical composition of warm
        (sub-)Neptunes as a typical case study. The metallicity of such
        atmospheres is totally uncertain and are likely to vary to
        values up to 100{\texttimes} solar. We explore the space of
        unknown parameters to predict the range of possible atmospheric
        compositions. \textbackslash Methods: We use a one-dimensional
        chemical code to compute a grid of models with various thermal
        profiles, metallicities, eddy diffusion coefficient profiles,
        and stellar UV incident fluxes. Thanks to a radiative transfer
        code, we then compute the corresponding emission and
        transmission spectra of the planet and compare them with the
        observational data already published. \textbackslash Results:
        Within the parameter space explored we find that methane is the
        major carbon-bearing species in most cases. We, however, find
        that for high metallicities with a sufficiently high
        temperature, the CH$_{4}$/CO abundance ratio can become lower
        than unity, as suggested by some multiwavelength photometric
        observations of other warm (sub-)Neptunes, such as GJ 1214b and
        GJ 436b. As for the emission spectrum of GJ 3470b, brightness
        temperatures at infrared wavelengths may vary between 400 and
        800 K depending on the thermal profile and metallicity.
        \textbackslash Conclusions: Combined with a hot temperature
        profile, a substantial enrichment in heavy elements by a factor
        of {\ensuremath{\geq}}100 with respect to the solar composition
        can shift the carbon balance in favour of carbon monoxide at the
        expense of methane. Nevertheless, current observations of this
        planet do not allow us yet to determine which model is more
        accurate.}",

        a planet around the habitable zone. We focus on conditions
        reminiscent to those of the Earth system, but our investigation
        has more general relevance and aims at presenting a general
        methodology for dealing with exoplanets. We describe a formalism
        able to provide a thorough analysis of the non-equilibrium
        thermodynamical properties of the climate system and explore,
        using a flexible climate model, how such properties depend on
        the energy input of the parent star, on the infrared atmospheric
        opacity, and on the rotation rate of the planet. We first show
        that it is possible to reproduce the multi-stability properties
        reminiscent of the paleoclimatologically relevant snowball
        (SB)-warm (W) conditions. We then characterise the
        thermodynamics of the simulated W and SB states, clarifying the
        central role of the hydrological cycle in shaping the
        irreversibility and the efficiency of the W states, and
        emphasizing the extreme diversity of the SB states, where dry
        conditions are realized. Thermodynamics provides the clue for
        studying the tipping points of the system and leads us to
        constructing empirical parametrizations allowing for expressing
        the main thermodynamic properties as functions of the emission
        temperature of the planet only. Such empirical functions are
        shown to be rather robust with respect to changing the rotation
        rate of the planet from the current terrestrial one to half of
        it. Furthermore, we explore the dynamical range where the length
        of the day and the length of the year are comparable. We clearly
        find that there is a critical rotation rate below which the
        multi-stability properties are lost, and the ice-albedo feedback
        responsible for the presence of SB and W conditions is damped.
        The bifurcation graph of the system suggests the presence of a
        phase transition in the planetary system. Such critical rotation
        rate corresponds roughly to the phase-lock 2:1 condition.
        Therefore, if an Earth-like planet is 1:1 phase-locked with
        respect to the parent star, only one climatic state would be
        compatible with a given set of astronomical and astrophysical
        parameters. These results have relevance for the general theory
        of planetary circulation and for the definition of necessary and
        sufficient conditions for habitability.}",

        to measure the amplitude, shape and phase of the thermal phase
        effect for WASP-18 b. We find that our results for the thermal
        phase effect are limited to an accuracy of about 0.01 per cent
        by systematic noise sources of unknown origin. At this level of
        accuracy we find that the thermal phase effect has a peak-to-
        peak amplitude approximately equal to the secondary eclipse
        depth, has a sinusoidal shape and that the maximum brightness
        occurs at the same phase as mid-occultation to within about 5

     abstract = "{We investigate the effects of atmospheric circulation on the chemistry
        of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We use a simplified dynamical
        model and a robust chemical network, as opposed to previous
        studies, which have used a three-dimensional circulation model
        coupled to a simple chemical kinetics scheme. The temperature
        structure and distribution of the main atmospheric constituents
        are calculated in the limit of an atmosphere that rotates as a
        solid body with an equatorial rotation rate of 1 km s$^{-1}$.
        Such motion mimics a uniform zonal wind, which resembles the
        equatorial superrotation structure found by three-dimensional
        circulation models. The uneven heating of this tidally locked
        planet causes, even in the presence of such a strong zonal wind,
        large temperature contrasts, up to 800 K, between the dayside
        and nightside. This would result in important longitudinal
        variations of some molecular abundances if the atmosphere were
        at chemical equilibrium. The zonal wind, however, acts as a
        powerful disequilibrium process. We identify the existence of a
        pressure level of transition between two regimes, which may be
        located between 100 and 0.1 mbar depending on the molecule.
        Below this transition layer, chemical equilibrium holds. Above
        it, however, the zonal wind tends to homogenise the chemical
        composition of the atmosphere, bringing molecular abundances in
        the limb and nightside regions close to chemical equilibrium
        values characteristic of the dayside, i.e. producing a
        horizontal quenching effect in the abundances. Reasoning based
        on timescale arguments indicates that horizontal and vertical
        mixing are likely to compete in HD 209458b's atmosphere,
        producing a complex distribution where molecular abundances are
        quenched horizontally to dayside values and vertically to
        chemical equilibrium values characteristic of deep layers.
        Either assuming pure horizontal mixing or pure vertical mixing,
        we find substantial variations in the molecular abundances at
        the evening and morning limbs, up to one order of magnitude for
        CH$_{4}$. This may have consequences for the interpretation of
        transmission spectra that sample the planet's terminator of hot

        irradiation, mixing, and circulation, their chemical composition
        is maintained out of equilibrium and must be modeled with
        kinetic models. \textbackslash Aims: Our purpose is to release a
        chemical network and the associated rate coefficients, developed
        for the temperature and pressure range relevant to hot Jupiters
        atmospheres. Using this network, we study the vertical
        atmospheric composition of the two hot Jupiters (HD 209458b and
        HD 189733b) with a model that includes photolyses and vertical
        mixing, and we produce synthetic spectra. \textbackslash
        Methods: The chemical scheme has been derived from applied
        combustion models that were methodically validated over a range
        of temperatures and pressures typical of the atmospheric layers
        influencing the observations of hot Jupiters. We compared the
        predictions obtained from this scheme with equilibrium
        calculations, with different schemes available in the literature
        that contain N-bearing species, and with previously published
        photochemical models. \textbackslash Results: Compared to other
        chemical schemes that were not subjected to the same systematic
        validation, we find significant differences whenever
        nonequilibrium processes take place (photodissociations or
        vertical mixing). The deviations from the equilibrium, hence the
        sensitivity to the network, are larger for HD 189733b, since we
        assume a cooler atmosphere than for HD 209458b. We found that
        the abundances of NH$_{3}$ and HCN can vary by two orders of
        magnitude depending on the network, demonstrating the importance
        of comprehensive experimental validation. A spectral feature of
        NH$_{3}$ at 10.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m is sensitive to these
        abundance variations and thus to the chemical scheme.
        \textbackslash Conclusions: Due to the influence of the
        kinetics, we recommend using a validated scheme to model the
        chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres. The network we release is
        robust for temperatures within 300-2500 K and pressures from 10
        mbar up to a few hundred bars, for species made of C, H, O, and
        N. It is validated for species up to 2 carbon atoms and for the
        main nitrogen species (NH$_{3}$, HCN, N$_{2}$, NO$_{x}$).
        Although the influence of the kinetic scheme on the hot Jupiters
        spectra remains within the current observational error bars
        (with the exception of NH$_{3}$), it will become more important
        for atmospheres that are cooler or subjected to higher UV
        fluxes, because they depart more from equilibrium.

     abstract = "{Favored theories of giant planet formation center around two main
        paradigms, namely the core accretion model and the gravitational
        instability model. These two formation scenarios support the
        hypothesis that the giant planet metallicities should be higher
        or equal to that of the parent star. Meanwhile, spectra of the
        transiting hot Jupiter HD189733b suggest that carbon and oxygen
        abundances range from depleted to enriched with respect to the
        star. Here, using a model describing the formation sequence and
        composition of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk, we
        determine the range of volatile abundances in the envelope of
        HD189733b that is consistent with the 20-80 M
        $_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$ of heavy elements estimated to be
        present in the planet's envelope. We then compare the inferred
        carbon and oxygen abundances to those retrieved from
        spectroscopy, and we find a range of supersolar values that
        directly fit both spectra and internal structure models. In some
        cases, we find that the apparent contradiction between the
        subsolar elemental abundances and the mass of heavy elements
        predicted in HD189733b by internal structure models can be
        explained by the presence of large amounts of carbon molecules
        in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soots in the
        upper layers of the envelope, as suggested by recent
        photochemical models. A diagnostic test that would confirm the
        presence of these compounds in the envelope is the detection of
        acetylene. Several alternative hypotheses that could also
        explain the subsolar metallicity of HD189733b are formulated:
        the possibility of differential settling in its envelope, the
        presence of a larger core that did not erode with time, a mass
        of heavy elements lower than the one predicted by interior
        models, a heavy element budget resulting from the accretion of
        volatile-poor planetesimals in specific circumstances, or the
        combination of all these mechanisms.}",

        knowledge of their masses and radii allows an estimate of their
        composition, but uncertainties on equations of state, opacities
        and possible missing energy sources imply that only inaccurate
        constraints can be derived when considering each planet
        separately.\textbackslashAims.We seek to better understand the
        composition of transiting extrasolar planets by considering them
        as an ensemble, and by comparing the obtained planetary
        properties to that of the parent stars.\textbackslashMethods.We
        use evolution models and constraints on the stellar ages to
        derive the mass of heavy elements present in the planets.
        Possible additional energy sources like tidal dissipation due to
        an inclined orbit or to downward kinetic energy transport are
        considered.\textbackslashResults.We show that the nine
        transiting planets discovered so far belong to a quite
        homogeneous ensemble that is characterized by a mass of heavy
        elements that is a relatively steep function of the stellar
        metallicity, from less than 20 earth masses of heavy elements
        around solar composition stars, to up to
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde100 M\_{\ensuremath{\oplus}} for
        three times the solar metallicity (the precise values being
        model-dependant). The correlation is still to be ascertained
        however. Statistical tests imply a worst-case 1/3 probability of
        a false positive.\textbackslashConclusions.Together with the
        observed lack of giant planets in close orbits around metal-poor
        stars, these results appear to imply that heavy elements play a
        key role in the formation of close-in giant planets. The large
        masses of heavy elements inferred for planets orbiting metal
        rich stars was not anticipated by planet formation models and
        shows the need for alternative theories including migration and
        subsequent collection of planetesimals.}",

        209458b and investigate its thermal structure and chemical
        composition. In a first step, the stellar heating profile and
        radiative timescales were calculated under planet-averaged
        insolation conditions. We find that 99.99\% of the incoming
        stellar flux has been absorbed before reaching the 7 bar level.
        Stellar photons cannot therefore penetrate deeply enough to
        explain the large radius of the planet. We derive a radiative
        time constant which increases with depth and reaches about 8 h
        at 0.1 bar and 2.3 days at 1 bar. Time-dependent temperature
        profiles were also calculated, in the limit of a zonal wind that
        is independent of height (i.e. solid-body rotation) and constant
        absorption coefficients. We predict day-night variations of the
        effective temperature of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde600 K,
        for an equatorial rotation rate of 1 km s$^{-1}$, in good
        agreement with the predictions by Showmann \& Guillot (2002).
        This rotation rate yields day-to-night temperature variations in
        excess of 600 K above the 0.1-bar level. These variations
        rapidly decrease with depth below the 1-bar level and become
        negligible below the \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5-bar level
        for rotation rates of at least 0.5 km s$^{-1}$. At high
        altitudes (mbar pressures or less), the night temperatures are
        low enough to allow sodium to condense into Na2S. Synthetic
        transit spectra of the visible Na doublet show a much weaker
        sodium absorption on the morning limb than on the evening limb.
        The calculated dimming of the sodium feature during planetary
        transites agrees with the value reported by Charbonneau et al.
        (2002).}",

        from the statistical thermodynamics of Lunine and Stevenson
        (1985, Astrophys. J. Suppl. 58, 493-531), and occurs in an
        evolutionary turbulent solar nebula described by the model of
        Hersant et al. (2001, Astrophys. J. 554, 391-407). It is assumed
        that clathrate hydrates were incorporated into the icy grains
        that formed cometesimals. The strong depletion of the N $_{2}$
        molecule with respect to CO observed in some comets is explained
        by the fact that CO forms clathrate hydrates much more easily
        than does N $_{2}$. The efficiency of this depletion, as well as
        the amount of trapped CO, depends upon the amount of water ice
        available in the region where the clathration took place. This
        might explain the diversity of CO abundances observed in comets.
        The same theory, applied to the trapping of volatiles around 5
        AU, explains the enrichments in Ar, Kr, Xe, C, and N with
        respect to the solar abundance measured in the deep troposphere
        of Jupiter (Gautier et al., 2001a,b).}",
