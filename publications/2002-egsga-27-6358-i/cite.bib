 abstract = {Multi-Axis-DOAS measurements, based upon the renowned DOAS technique
(Platt, 1994) provide a methodology to resolve spatial
distributions of various trace gases using scattered light from
the sun or other non-artificial sources. Two basic tech- niques
can be used: one telescope trained in different directions
sequentially by means of a mechanical motor drive, or several
telescopes directing their light onto a two- dimensional CCD-
Chip which allows for simultaneous measurements in several di-
rections. As part of the IUP Heidelberg tomography group's
contribution to the BAB II campaign in April and May 2001, a CCD
based MAX DOAS apparatus with ten telescopes was placed near the
A 656 motorway. It measured the NO2 Slant Column Densities using
scattered sunlight with a time resolution of 1 minute. Three
telescopes were directed across the motorway, and three parallel
to it. Because of this geometry, the data can be compared to the
SCD derived from the long path DOAS measurements performed
during the campaign. The setup allowed for the tracking of the
diurnal variation of a motorway plume, the assessment of the
vertical structure as well as the comparison with the plume
outreach of Heidelberg. Also insights into the technique
required for the spectral evaluation could be gained from the
study.},
