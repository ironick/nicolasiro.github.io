 abstract = {HD209458 is the first known star where a hot Jupiter-like planet was
fully characterized, with the aid of both RV and transit
detection methods. Ground-based follow-up observations of this
system have been carried out on the VLT instruments UVES and
ISAAC. We searched for absorption features of the planetary
extended atmosphere on top of the star spectrum by comparing the
spectra obtained at different epochs, during the planetary
transit and out of transit. Careful data reduction is required
to achieve the highest accuracy since the expected signatures
could be extremely faint. A description of the present state of
our data set will be given together with perspectives towards
future searches in this area.},
