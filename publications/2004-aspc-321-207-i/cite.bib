 abstract = {We developed a time-dependent radiative model for the atmosphere of
HD209458b to investigate its thermal structure and chemical
composition. Time-dependent temperature profiles were
calculated, using a uniform zonal wind modelled as a solid body
rotation. We predict day/night temperature variations of 600K
around 0.1 bar, for a 1 km/s wind velocity, in good agreement
with the predictions by Showman & Guillot (2002). On the night
side, the low temperature allows the sodium to condense.
Depletion of sodium in the morning limb may explain the lower
than expected abundance found by Charbonneau et al. (2002).},
