 abstract = {We searched for spectral signatures from the exosphere of HD 209-458b in
the UV and the near-IR with UVES and ISAAC at the VLT. We looked
in particular for the helium absorption feature at 10 830
̊A predicted to be among the strongest ones. The upper
limit of the He I line derived is 0.5% at 3
\ensuremathσ for a 3 \Å bandwith. Planet-induced
chromospheric activity search on HD209458 was also performed.},
