 abstract = {We have developed a new code that calculates the modulation of a star's
spectrum as a planet transits. We are applying this model to
data from the VLT, Palomar, Keck, and IRTF to search for water
on HD209458b, the transiting planet with the brightest primary.
\\Observations of HD209458b's stellar
spectrum modulation have yielded the first detections of
exoplanetary sodium (Charbonneau et al. 2001), hydrogen, oxygen
and carbon (Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003, 2004). Molecules, however,
have still avoided detection. Water is predicted to be abundant
at all plausible temperatures, but the modulation for most of
the observable features is <0.04%. By simultaneously fitting
for many excited water features while avoiding telluric water
lines, we can significantly increase our signal.
\\Our model predicts the modulation
given line data, system geometry, and thermal and abundance
profiles for any transiting planet. We will use this code to
compare the observed modulation for HD209458b with that
predicted by different planetary theories, do calculations for
specific instruments with different resolutions and wavelength
ranges, and constrain the abundances of detected species.
\\We find that integrating the
extinction over altitude produces significantly better results
than assuming that the planet is an opaque disk whose radius is
the altitude of optical depth unity. The latter is a widely used
simplification. Our work will allow us to establish or place
strong limits on the water abundance in HD209458b's atmosphere.
Even a non-detection will be important, as it will require
significant modifications to existing theory and/or will justify
the need for better space-based instruments.
