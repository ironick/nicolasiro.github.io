 abstract = {We present a time-dependent radiative model of the atmosphere of HD
209458b and investigate its thermal structure and chemical
composition. In a first step, the stellar heating profile and
radiative timescales were calculated under planet-averaged
insolation conditions. We find that 99.99% of the incoming
stellar flux has been absorbed before reaching the 7 bar level.
Stellar photons cannot therefore penetrate deeply enough to
explain the large radius of the planet. We derive a radiative
time constant which increases with depth and reaches about 8 h
at 0.1 bar and 2.3 days at 1 bar. Time-dependent temperature
profiles were also calculated, in the limit of a zonal wind that
is independent of height (i.e. solid-body rotation) and constant
absorption coefficients. We predict day-night variations of the
effective temperature of åisebox-0.5ex~600 K,
for an equatorial rotation rate of 1 km s$^-1$, in good
agreement with the predictions by Showmann & Guillot (2002).
This rotation rate yields day-to-night temperature variations in
excess of 600 K above the 0.1-bar level. These variations
rapidly decrease with depth below the 1-bar level and become
negligible below the \i̊sebox-0.5ex~5-bar level
for rotation rates of at least 0.5 km s$^-1$. At high
altitudes (mbar pressures or less), the night temperatures are
low enough to allow sodium to condense into Na2S. Synthetic
transit spectra of the visible Na doublet show a much weaker
sodium absorption on the morning limb than on the evening limb.
The calculated dimming of the sodium feature during planetary
transites agrees with the value reported by Charbonneau et al.
(2002).},
