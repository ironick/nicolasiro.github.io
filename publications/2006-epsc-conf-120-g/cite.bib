 abstract = {Ten extrasolar planets with masses between 105 and
430M\ensuremathøplus are known to transit their star. The
knowledge of their mass and radius allows an estimate of their
composition, but uncertainties on equations of state, opacities
and possible missing energy sources imply that only inaccurate
constraints can be derived when considering each planet
separately. This is illustrated by HD209458b and XO-1b, two
planets that appear to be larger than models would predict.
Using a relatively simple evolution model, we show that the
radius anomaly, i.e. the difference between the measured and
theoretically calculated radii, is anticorrelated with the
metallicity of the parent star. This implies that the present
size, structure and composition of these planets is largely
determined by the initial metallicity of the protoplanetary
disk, and not, or to a lesser extent, by other processes such as
the differences in the planets' orbital evolutions, tides due to
finite eccentricities/inclinations and planet evaporation. Using
evolution models including the presence of a core and
parametrized missing physics, we show that all nine planets
belong to a same ensemble characterized by a mass of heavy
elements MZ that is a steep function of the stellar metallicity:
from \ensuremath∼ 10 M\ensuremathøplus around a
solar composition star, to \ensuremath∼ 100
M\ensuremathøplus for twice the solar metallicity. Together
with the observed lack of giant planets in close orbits around
metal-poor stars, these results imply that heavy elements play a
key role in the formation of close-in giant planets. The large
values of MZ and of the planet enrichments for metal-rich stars
shows the need for alternative theories of planet formation
including migration and subsequent collection of planetesimals.},
