 abstract = {In our search for clues as to the nature of the exosphere of HD209458
(Moutou et al., 2001 ; Moutou et al., 2003, Iro et al., 2004),
we have acquired VLT/UVES data during an ambitious observational
campaign performed in June-September 2002 and covering 5
transits of the exoplanet. The resolving power was R=100000 in
the 0.475- 0.68 micron range. We search for ions and neutral
molecules (such as H2O+, CO+, CH+, . . . ) originating in the
planet's exosphere and located in the evaporated material around
the planet, occulting its primary star. This study requires
attentive reduction of the data and analysis. We will indicate
our progress in investigating the spectra. References: Iro, N.,
