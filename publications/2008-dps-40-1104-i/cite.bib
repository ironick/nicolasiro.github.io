 abstract = {A large fraction of exoplanets have an eccentric orbit. In the case of
HD 80606b (e = 0.932) this leads to a factor 800 in the stellar
flux received by the planet between apoastron and periastron.
\\We will present a time-dependent
radiative model for the atmosphere of extrasolar planets that
take into account the eccentricity of their orbit. We first
investigate their thermal structure, chemical composition and
spectral characteristics for phase-averaged incoming stellar
heating. We then explore the temporal temperature and flux
variations due to the planet-star distance variation and pseudo-
synchronous rotation. \\We will also
discuss observational aspects for some planets suitable for
Spitzer measurement.},
