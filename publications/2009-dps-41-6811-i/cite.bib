 abstract = {We analyze the thermal infrared spectra of Saturn obtained by the
Cassini-CIRS instrument to infer thermal and cloud information
for Saturn's stratosphere and upper troposphere. We use a narrow
spectral window centered at 1392 cm-1 which allows us to
characterize Saturn's atmosphere as deep as 1 bar and is only
dependent on molecular species tha are well constrained (CH4 and
H2). \\Therefore an excess of
atmospheric opacity at this wavelength can be attributed to the
presence of additional atmospheric absorbers (haze or cloud
particules). \\The study of the zonal
mean brightness temperature at 1392 cm-1 exhibits two regions
with qualitative different behaviour in the southern hemisphere:
\­ The region south of 65S shows a
higher than expected brightness temperature. This indicates that
the emission is likely to originate from the warm upper
stratosphere -- around the 10 mbar pressure level -- possibly by
a haze layer. \­ On the other hand,
\\the mid-latitudes (20S-55S) show
relatively low brightness temperatures with emission coming from
the upper troposphere (near and above 1 bar pressure)
\\We use a numerical inversion to
constrain the absorption coefficient, the optical thickness and
the pressure level of the cloud/haze structure in Saturn's
southern hemisphere and present the results for selected
latitudes. We use a chi square optimization in order to validate
the results of the numerical inversion.},
