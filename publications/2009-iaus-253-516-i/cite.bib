 abstract = {We present a time-dependent radiative model for the atmosphere of the
transiting planets that takes into account the eccentricity of
their orbit. We investigate the temporal temperature and flux
variations due to the planet-star distance variability. We will
also discuss observational aspects with Spitzer measurements.},
