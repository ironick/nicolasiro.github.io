 abstract = {The energy deposition and redistribution in hot Jupiter atmospheres is
not well understood currently, but is a major factor for their
evolution and survival. We will present a time dependent
radiative model for the atmosphere of WASP-18b which is a
massive hot Jupiter exoplanet (10 MJup) orbiting an F6V star
with an orbital period of only 0.94 days. The results of the
model will be compared to new results from a Spitzer campaign to
observe lightcurves at 3.6-micron and 4.5- micron. The observed
phase curve flux variation - in particular the extremely dark
night side of the planet - suggests that the efficiency of heat
distribution from the day-side to the night-side of the planet
is extremely inefficient. The amplitude, phase and shape of the
phase variation in WASP-18b were also measured. This enables us
to put strong constraints on the efficiency of heat
redistribution in this planetary system and to determine the
pressure level at which the heat distribution occurs.},
