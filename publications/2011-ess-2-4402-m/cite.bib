 abstract = {WASP-18b is a massive hot Jupiter exoplanet (10 MJup) which orbits an
F6V star with an orbital period of only 0.94 days. The energy
deposition and redistribution in hot Jupiter atmospheres is not
well understood currently, but is a major factor for their
evolution and survival. We present new results from a Spitzer
campaign to observe lightcurves at 3.6-micron and 4.5-micron The
minimum flux of the phase variation compared to the eclipse
depth shows that the unheated hemisphere of WASP-18b is
extremely dark at 3.6-micron and 4.5-micron. This suggests that
the efficiency of heat distribution from the day-side to the
night-side of the planet is extremely inefficient. We have also
measured the amplitude, phase and shape of the phase variation
in WASP-18b. We will report the results of comparing these
parameters to the results of time dependent radiative models for
the atmosphere of WASP-18b. This enables us to put strong
constraints on the efficiency of heat redistribution in this
extreme planetary system and to determine the pressure level at
which the heat distribution occurs.},
