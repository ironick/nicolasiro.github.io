 abstract = {Context. The atmosphere of hot Jupiters can be probed by primary transit
and secondary eclipse spectroscopy. Owing to the intense UV
irradiation, mixing, and circulation, their chemical composition
is maintained out of equilibrium and must be modeled with
kinetic models. \ Aims: Our purpose is to release a
chemical network and the associated rate coefficients, developed
for the temperature and pressure range relevant to hot Jupiters
atmospheres. Using this network, we study the vertical
atmospheric composition of the two hot Jupiters (HD 209458b and
HD 189733b) with a model that includes photolyses and vertical
mixing, and we produce synthetic spectra. \
Methods: The chemical scheme has been derived from applied
combustion models that were methodically validated over a range
of temperatures and pressures typical of the atmospheric layers
influencing the observations of hot Jupiters. We compared the
predictions obtained from this scheme with equilibrium
calculations, with different schemes available in the literature
that contain N-bearing species, and with previously published
photochemical models. \ Results: Compared to other
chemical schemes that were not subjected to the same systematic
validation, we find significant differences whenever
nonequilibrium processes take place (photodissociations or
vertical mixing). The deviations from the equilibrium, hence the
sensitivity to the network, are larger for HD 189733b, since we
assume a cooler atmosphere than for HD 209458b. We found that
the abundances of NH$_3$ and HCN can vary by two orders of
magnitude depending on the network, demonstrating the importance
of comprehensive experimental validation. A spectral feature of
NH$_3$ at 10.5 \ensuremathμm is sensitive to these
abundance variations and thus to the chemical scheme.
\ Conclusions: Due to the influence of the
kinetics, we recommend using a validated scheme to model the
chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres. The network we release is
robust for temperatures within 300-2500 K and pressures from 10
mbar up to a few hundred bars, for species made of C, H, O, and
N. It is validated for species up to 2 carbon atoms and for the
main nitrogen species (NH$_3$, HCN, N$_2$, NO$_x$).
Although the influence of the kinetic scheme on the hot Jupiters
spectra remains within the current observational error bars
(with the exception of NH$_3$), it will become more important
for atmospheres that are cooler or subjected to higher UV
fluxes, because they depart more from equilibrium.
