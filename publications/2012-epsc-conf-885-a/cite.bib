 abstract = {We investigate the effects of circulation winds on the atmospheric
chemistry of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We identify the
existence of a pressure level of transition between two regimes,
whose location depend on each molecule. Below this transition
layer, chemical equilibrium holds, while above it, winds tend to
homogenize the chemical composition of the atmosphere, bringing
molecular abundances in the nightside close to those prevailing
in the dayside. We find moderate abundance variations for some
molecules such as CO2 between the morning and evening limbs,
which would have consequences for transmission spectra that
sample the planet's terminator of hot Jupiters.},
