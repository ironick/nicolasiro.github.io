 abstract = {In this paper we explore the potential multistability of the climate for
a planet around the habitable zone. We focus on conditions
reminiscent to those of the Earth system, but our investigation
has more general relevance and aims at presenting a general
methodology for dealing with exoplanets. We describe a formalism
able to provide a thorough analysis of the non-equilibrium
thermodynamical properties of the climate system and explore,
using a flexible climate model, how such properties depend on
the energy input of the parent star, on the infrared atmospheric
opacity, and on the rotation rate of the planet. We first show
that it is possible to reproduce the multi-stability properties
reminiscent of the paleoclimatologically relevant snowball
(SB)-warm (W) conditions. We then characterise the
thermodynamics of the simulated W and SB states, clarifying the
central role of the hydrological cycle in shaping the
irreversibility and the efficiency of the W states, and
emphasizing the extreme diversity of the SB states, where dry
conditions are realized. Thermodynamics provides the clue for
studying the tipping points of the system and leads us to
constructing empirical parametrizations allowing for expressing
the main thermodynamic properties as functions of the emission
temperature of the planet only. Such empirical functions are
shown to be rather robust with respect to changing the rotation
rate of the planet from the current terrestrial one to half of
it. Furthermore, we explore the dynamical range where the length
of the day and the length of the year are comparable. We clearly
find that there is a critical rotation rate below which the
multi-stability properties are lost, and the ice-albedo feedback
responsible for the presence of SB and W conditions is damped.
The bifurcation graph of the system suggests the presence of a
phase transition in the planetary system. Such critical rotation
rate corresponds roughly to the phase-lock 2:1 condition.
Therefore, if an Earth-like planet is 1:1 phase-locked with
respect to the parent star, only one climatic state would be
compatible with a given set of astronomical and astrophysical
parameters. These results have relevance for the general theory
of planetary circulation and for the definition of necessary and
sufficient conditions for habitability.},
