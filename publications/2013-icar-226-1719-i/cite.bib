 abstract = {The energy deposition and redistribution in hot Jupiter atmospheres is
not well understood currently, but is a major factor for their
evolution and survival. We present a time dependent radiative
transfer model for the atmosphere of WASP-18b which is a massive
(10M$_Jup$) hot Jupiter (T$_eq$ \ensuremath∼ 2400 K)
exoplanet orbiting an F6V star with an orbital period of only
0.94 days. \\Our model includes a
simplified parametrisation of the day-to-night energy
redistribution by a modulation of the stellar heating mimicking
a solid body rotation of the atmosphere. We present the cases
with either no rotation at all with respect to the synchronously
rotating reference frame or a fast differential rotation.
\\The results of the model are
compared to previous observations of secondary eclipses of
Nymeyer et al. (Nymeyer, S. et al. [2011]. Astrophys. J. 742,
35) with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Their observed planetary
flux suggests that the efficiency of heat distribution from the
day-side to the night-side of the planet is extremely
inefficient. Our results are consistent with the fact that such
large day-side fluxes can be obtained only if there is no
rotation of the atmosphere.
\\Additionally, we infer light curves
of the planet for a full orbit in the two Warm Spitzer
bandpassses for the two cases of rotation and discuss the
observational differences.},
