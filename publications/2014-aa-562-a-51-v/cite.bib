 abstract = {Context. Current observation techniques are able to probe the atmosphere
of some giant exoplanets and get some clues about their
atmospheric composition. However, the chemical compositions
derived from observations are not fully understood. For
instance, the CH$_4$/CO abundance ratio is often inferred to
be different from the value that has been predicted by chemical
models. Recently, the warm Neptune GJ 3470b has been discovered,
and because of its close distance from us and high transit
depth, it is a very promising candidate for follow-up
characterisation of its atmosphere. \ Aims: We
study the atmospheric composition of GJ 3470b to compare to the
current observations of this planet and to prepare for future
ones but also to understand the chemical composition of warm
(sub-)Neptunes as a typical case study. The metallicity of such
atmospheres is totally uncertain and are likely to vary to
values up to 100× solar. We explore the space of
unknown parameters to predict the range of possible atmospheric
compositions. \ Methods: We use a one-dimensional
chemical code to compute a grid of models with various thermal
profiles, metallicities, eddy diffusion coefficient profiles,
and stellar UV incident fluxes. Thanks to a radiative transfer
code, we then compute the corresponding emission and
transmission spectra of the planet and compare them with the
observational data already published. \ Results:
Within the parameter space explored we find that methane is the
major carbon-bearing species in most cases. We, however, find
that for high metallicities with a sufficiently high
temperature, the CH$_4$/CO abundance ratio can become lower
than unity, as suggested by some multiwavelength photometric
observations of other warm (sub-)Neptunes, such as GJ 1214b and
GJ 436b. As for the emission spectrum of GJ 3470b, brightness
temperatures at infrared wavelengths may vary between 400 and
800 K depending on the thermal profile and metallicity.
\ Conclusions: Combined with a hot temperature
profile, a substantial enrichment in heavy elements by a factor
of \ensuremath≥100 with respect to the solar composition
can shift the carbon balance in favour of carbon monoxide at the
expense of methane. Nevertheless, current observations of this
planet do not allow us yet to determine which model is more
accurate.},
