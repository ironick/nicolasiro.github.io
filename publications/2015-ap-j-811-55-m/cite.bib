 abstract = {We report on novel observations of HAT-P-1 aimed at constraining the
optical transmission spectrum of the atmosphere of its
transiting hot-Jupiter exoplanet. Ground-based differential
spectrophotometry was performed over two transit windows using
the DOLORES spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo.
Our measurements imply an average planet to star radius ratio
equal to R$_p$/R$_*$ = (0.1159 \ensuremath± 0.0005).
This result is consistent with the value obtained from recent
near-infrared measurements of this object, but differs from
previously reported optical measurements, being lower by around
4.4 exoplanet scale heights. Analyzing the data over five
different spectral bins of \ensuremath∼600 ̊A wide,
we observed a single peaked spectrum (3.7 \ensuremathσ
level) with a blue cutoff corresponding to the blue edge of the
broad absorption wing of sodium and an increased absorption in
the region in-between 6180 and 7400 \Å. We also infer that
the width of the broad absorption wings due to alkali metals is
likely narrower than the one implied by solar abundance clear
atmospheric models. We interpret the result as evidence that
HAT-P-1b has a partially clear atmosphere at optical wavelengths
with a more modest contribution from an optical absorber than
previously reported.},
