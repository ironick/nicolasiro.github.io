 abstract = {The discovery of almost two thousand exoplanets has revealed an
unexpectedly diverse planet population. We see gas giants in
few-day orbits, whole multi-planet systems within the orbit of
Mercury, and new populations of planets with masses between that
of the Earth and Neptune—all unknown in the Solar
System. Observations to date have shown that our Solar System is
certainly not representative of the general population of
planets in our Milky Way. The key science questions that
urgently need addressing are therefore: What are exoplanets made
of? Why are planets as they are? How do planetary systems work
and what causes the exceptional diversity observed as compared
to the Solar System? The EChO (Exoplanet Characterisation
Observatory) space mission was conceived to take up the
challenge to explain this diversity in terms of formation,
evolution, internal structure and planet and atmospheric
composition. This requires in-depth spectroscopic knowledge of
the atmospheres of a large and well-defined planet sample for
which precise physical, chemical and dynamical information can
be obtained. In order to fulfil this ambitious scientific
program, EChO was designed as a dedicated survey mission for
transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable of observing a large,
diverse and well-defined planet sample within its 4-year mission
lifetime. The transit and eclipse spectroscopy method, whereby
the signal from the star and planet are differentiated using
knowledge of the planetary ephemerides, allows us to measure
atmospheric signals from the planet at levels of at least
10$^-4$ relative to the star. This can only be achieved in
conjunction with a carefully designed stable payload and
satellite platform. It is also necessary to provide broad
instantaneous wavelength coverage to detect as many molecular
species as possible, to probe the thermal structure of the
planetary atmospheres and to correct for the contaminating
effects of the stellar photosphere. This requires wavelength
coverage of at least 0.55 to 11 \ensuremathμm with a goal
of covering from 0.4 to 16 \ensuremathμm. Only modest
spectral resolving power is needed, with R
åisebox-0.5ex~ 300 for wavelengths less than 5
\ensuremathμm and R \i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 30
for wavelengths greater than this. The transit spectroscopy
technique means that no spatial resolution is required. A
telescope collecting area of about 1 m$^2$ is sufficiently
large to achieve the necessary spectro-photometric precision:
for the Phase A study a 1.13 m$^2$ telescope, diffraction
limited at 3 \ensuremathμm has been adopted. Placing the
satellite at L2 provides a cold and stable thermal environment
as well as a large field of regard to allow efficient time-
critical observation of targets randomly distributed over the
sky. EChO has been conceived to achieve a single goal: exoplanet
spectroscopy. The spectral coverage and signal-to-noise to be
achieved by EChO, thanks to its high stability and dedicated
design, would be a game changer by allowing atmospheric
composition to be measured with unparalleled exactness: at least
a factor 10 more precise and a factor 10 to 1000 more accurate
than current observations. This would enable the detection of
molecular abundances three orders of magnitude lower than
currently possible and a fourfold increase from the handful of
molecules detected to date. Combining these data with estimates
of planetary bulk compositions from accurate measurements of
their radii and masses would allow degeneracies associated with
planetary interior modelling to be broken, giving unique insight
into the interior structure and elemental abundances of these
alien worlds. EChO would allow scientists to study exoplanets
both as a population and as individuals. The mission can target
super-Earths, Neptune-like, and Jupiter-like planets, in the
very hot to temperate zones (planet temperatures of 300-3000 K)
of F to M-type host stars. The EChO core science would be
delivered by a three-tier survey. The EChO Chemical Census: This
is a broad survey of a few-hundred exoplanets, which allows us
to explore the spectroscopic and chemical diversity of the
exoplanet population as a whole. The EChO Origin: This is a deep
survey of a subsample of tens of exoplanets for which
significantly higher signal to noise and spectral resolution
spectra can be obtained to explain the origin of the exoplanet
diversity (such as formation mechanisms, chemical processes,
atmospheric escape). The EChO Rosetta Stones: This is an ultra-
high accuracy survey targeting a subsample of select exoplanets.
These will be the bright ``benchmark'' cases for which a large
number of measurements would be taken to explore temporal
variations, and to obtain two and three dimensional spatial
information on the atmospheric conditions through eclipse-
mapping techniques. If EChO were launched today, the exoplanets
currently observed are sufficient to provide a large and diverse
sample. The Chemical Census survey would consist of > 160
exoplanets with a range of planetary sizes, temperatures,
orbital parameters and stellar host properties. Additionally,
over the next 10 years, several new ground- and space-based
transit photometric surveys and missions will come on-line (e.g.
NGTS, CHEOPS, TESS, PLATO), which will specifically focus on
finding bright, nearby systems. The current rapid rate of
discovery would allow the target list to be further optimised in
the years prior to EChO's launch and enable the atmospheric
characterisation of hundreds of planets.},
