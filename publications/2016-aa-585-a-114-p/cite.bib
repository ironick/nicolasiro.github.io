 abstract = {\ Aims: We search for Rayleigh scattering and K and Na
absorption signatures from the atmosphere of TrES-3b using
ground-based transmission spectroscopy covering the wavelength
range from 530 to 950 nm as observed with the OSIRIS instrument
at the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS. \ Methods: Our
analysis is based on a Bayesian approach where the light curves
covering a set of given passbands are fitted jointly with
PHOENIX-calculated stellar limb darkening profiles. The analysis
is carried out assuming both white and red noise that is
temporally correlated, with two approaches (Gaussian processes
and divide-by-white) to account for the red noise.
\ Results: An initial analysis reveals a
transmission spectrum that shows a strong Rayleigh-like increase
in extinction towards the blue end of the spectrum, and enhanced
extinction around the K I resonance doublet near 767 nm.
However, the signal amplitudes are significantly larger than
expected from theoretical considerations. A detailed analysis
reveals that the K I-like feature is entirely due to variability
in the telluric O$_2$ absorption, but the Rayleigh-like
feature remains unexplained. \\The
