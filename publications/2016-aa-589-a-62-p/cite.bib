 abstract = {Context. The launch of the exoplanet space missions obtaining exquisite
photometry from space has resulted in the discovery of thousands
of planetary systems with very different physical properties and
architectures. Among them, the exoplanet CoRoT-29b was
identified in the light curves the mission obtained in summer
2011, and presented an asymmetric transit light curve, which was
tentatively explained via the effects of gravity darkening.
\ Aims: Transits of CoRoT-29b are measured with
precision photometry, to characterize the reported asymmetry in
their transit shape. \ Methods: Using the OSIRIS
spectrograph at the 10-m GTC telescope, we perform spectro-
photometric differential observations, which allow us to both
calculate a high-accuracy photometric light curve, and a study
of the color-dependence of the transit. \ Results:
After careful data analysis, we find that the previously
reported asymmetry is not present in either of two transits,
observed in July 2014 and July 2015 with high photometric
precisions of 300 ppm over 5 min. Due to the relative faintness
of the star, we do not reach the precision necessary to perform
transmission spectroscopy of its atmosphere, but we see no signs
of color-dependency of the transit depth or duration.
\ Conclusions: We conclude that the previously
reported asymmetry may have been a time-dependent phenomenon,
which did not occur in more recent epochs. Alternatively,
instrumental effects in the discovery data may need to be
reconsidered. \\Light curves are only
