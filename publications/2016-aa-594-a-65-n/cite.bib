 abstract = {We observed the hot Jupiter <ASTROBJ>HAT-P-32b</ASTROBJ> (also known as
HAT-P-32Ab) to determine its optical transmission spectrum by
measuring the wavelength-dependent, planet-to-star radius ratios
in the region between 518-918 nm. We used the OSIRIS instrument
at the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) in long-slit spectroscopy
mode, placing <ASTROBJ>HAT-P-32</ASTROBJ> and a reference star
in the same slit and obtaining a time series of spectra covering
two transit events. Using the best quality data set, we were
able to yield 20 narrowband transit light curves, with each
passband spanning a 20 nm wide interval. After removal of all
systematic noise signals and light curve modeling, the
uncertainties for the resulting radius ratios lie between 337
and 972 ppm. The radius ratios show little variation with
wavelength, suggesting a high altitude cloud layer masking any
atmospheric features. Alternatively, a strong depletion in
alkali metals or a much smaller than expected planetary
atmospheric scale height could be responsible for the lack of
atmospheric features. Our result of a flat transmission spectrum
is consistent with a previous ground-based study of the optical
spectrum of this planet. This agreement between independent
results demonstrates that ground-based measurements of exoplanet
atmospheres can give reliable and reproducible results despite
the fact that the data often is heavily affected by systematic
noise as long as the noise source is well understood and
properly corrected. We also extract an optical spectrum of the
M-dwarf companion HAT-P-32B. Using PHOENIX stellar atmosphere
models we determine an effective temperature of T$_eff$ =
3187$^+60$$_-71$ K, which is slightly colder than previous
studies relying only on broadband infrared data.
