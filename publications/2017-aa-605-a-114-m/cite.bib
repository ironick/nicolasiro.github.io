 abstract = {Context. Transiting planets offer an excellent opportunity for
characterizing the atmospheres of extrasolar planets under very
different conditions from those found in our solar system.
\ Aims: We are currently carrying out a ground-
based survey to obtain the transmission spectra of several
extrasolar planets using the 10 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. In
this paper we investigate the extrasolar planet WASP-48b, a hot
Jupiter orbiting around an F-type star with a period of 2.14
days. \ Methods: We obtained long-slit optical
spectroscopy of one transit of WASP-48b with the Optical System
for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated
Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) spectrograph. We integrated the spectrum
of WASP-48 and one reference star in several channels with
different wavelength ranges, creating numerous color light
curves of the transit. We fit analytic transit curves to the
data taking into account the systematic effects present in the
time series in an effort to measure the change of the planet-to-
star radius ratio (R$_p$/R$_s$) across wavelength. The
change in transit depth can be compared with atmosphere models
to infer the presence of particular atomic or molecular
compounds in the atmosphere of WASP-48b. \ Results:
After removing the transit model and systematic trends to the
curves we reached precisions between 261 ppm and 455-755 ppm for
the white and spectroscopic light curves, respectively. We
obtained R$_p$/R$_s$ uncertainty values between 0.8
× 10$^-3$ and 1.5 × 10$^-3$ for all
the curves analyzed in this work. The measured transit depth for
the curves made by integrating the wavelength range between 530
nm and 905 nm is in agreement with previous studies. We report a
relatively flat transmission spectrum for WASP-48b with no
statistical significant detection of atmospheric species,
although the theoretical models that fit the data more closely
include TiO and VO. \\The transit
