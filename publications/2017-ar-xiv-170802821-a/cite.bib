 abstract = {The NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program's SAG15 group has solicited,
collected, and organized community input on high-level science
questions that could be addressed with future direct imaging
exoplanet missions and the type and quality of data answering
these questions will require. Input was solicited through a
variety of forums and the report draft was shared with the
exoplanet community continuously during the period of the report
development (Nov 2015 -- May 2017). The report benefitted from
the input of over 50 exoplanet scientists and from multiple
open-forum discussions at exoplanet and astrobiology meetings.
The SAG15 team has identified three group of high-level
questions, those that focus on the properties of planetary
systems (Questions A1--A2), those that focus on the properties
of individual planets (Questions B1--B4), and questions that
relate to planetary processes (Questions C1--C4). The questions
in categories A, B, and C require different target samples and
often different observational approaches. For each questions we
summarize the current body of knowledge, the available and
future observational approaches that can directly or indirectly
contribute to answering the question, and provide examples and
general considerations for the target sample required.},
