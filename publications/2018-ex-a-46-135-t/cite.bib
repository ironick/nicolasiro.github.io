 abstract = {Thousands of exoplanets have now been discovered with a huge range of
masses, sizes and orbits: from rocky Earth-like planets to large
gas giants grazing the surface of their host star. However, the
essential nature of these exoplanets remains largely mysterious:
there is no known, discernible pattern linking the presence,
size, or orbital parameters of a planet to the nature of its
parent star. We have little idea whether the chemistry of a
planet is linked to its formation environment, or whether the
type of host star drives the physics and chemistry of the
planet's birth, and evolution. ARIEL was conceived to observe a
large number ( 1000) of transiting planets for statistical
understanding, including gas giants, Neptunes, super-Earths and
Earth-size planets around a range of host star types using
transit spectroscopy in the 1.25-7.8 \ensuremathμm
spectral range and multiple narrow-band photometry in the
optical. ARIEL will focus on warm and hot planets to take
advantage of their well-mixed atmospheres which should show
minimal condensation and sequestration of high-Z materials
compared to their colder Solar System siblings. Said warm and
hot atmospheres are expected to be more representative of the
planetary bulk composition. Observations of these warm/hot
exoplanets, and in particular of their elemental composition
(especially C, O, N, S, Si), will allow the understanding of the
early stages of planetary and atmospheric formation during the
nebular phase and the following few million years. ARIEL will
thus provide a representative picture of the chemical nature of
the exoplanets and relate this directly to the type and chemical
environment of the host star. ARIEL is designed as a dedicated
survey mission for combined-light spectroscopy, capable of
observing a large and well-defined planet sample within its
4-year mission lifetime. Transit, eclipse and phase-curve
spectroscopy methods, whereby the signal from the star and
planet are differentiated using knowledge of the planetary
ephemerides, allow us to measure atmospheric signals from the
planet at levels of 10-100 part per million (ppm) relative to
the star and, given the bright nature of targets, also allows
more sophisticated techniques, such as eclipse mapping, to give
a deeper insight into the nature of the atmosphere. These types
of observations require a stable payload and satellite platform
with broad, instantaneous wavelength coverage to detect many
molecular species, probe the thermal structure, identify clouds
and monitor the stellar activity. The wavelength range proposed
covers all the expected major atmospheric gases from e.g.
H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ NH$_3$, HCN, H$_2$S through to
the more exotic metallic compounds, such as TiO, VO, and
condensed species. Simulations of ARIEL performance in
conducting exoplanet surveys have been performed - using
conservative estimates of mission performance and a full model
of all significant noise sources in the measurement - using a
list of potential ARIEL targets that incorporates the latest
available exoplanet statistics. The conclusion at the end of the
Phase A study, is that ARIEL - in line with the stated mission
objectives - will be able to observe about 1000 exoplanets
depending on the details of the adopted survey strategy, thus
confirming the feasibility of the main science objectives.},
