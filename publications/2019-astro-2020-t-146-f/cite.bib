 abstract = {We are now in the new era of the characterization of exoplanet
atmospheres. However, atmosphere models are often limited by
insufficiencies in the laboratory and theoretical data that
serve as critical inputs. Here we provide descriptions of areas
where new investigations could fill critical gaps in our ability
to model exoplanet atmospheres.},
