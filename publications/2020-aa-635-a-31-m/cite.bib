 abstract = {\ Aims: The atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are
commonly considered to be at thermochemical equilibrium. We aim
to provide disequilibrium chemistry maps for a global
understanding of the chemistry in the atmosphere of HAT-P-7b and
assess the importance of disequilibrium chemistry on UHJs.
\ Methods: We applied a hierarchical modeling
approach using 97 1D atmospheric profiles from a 3D general
circulation model of HAT-P-7b. For each atmospheric 1D profile,
we evaluated our kinetic cloud formation model consistently with
the local gas-phase composition in chemical equilibrium. This
served as input to study the quenching of dominating CHNO-
binding molecules. We evaluated quenching results from a zeroth-
order approximation in comparison to a kinetic gas-phase
approach. \ Results: We find that the zeroth-order
approach of estimating quenching points agrees well with the
full gas-kinetic modeling results. However, it underestimates
the quenching levels by about one order of magnitude at high
temperatures. Chemical disequilibrium has the greatest effect on
the nightside and morning abundance of species such as H,
H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, HCN, and all C$_n$H$_m$
molecules; heavier C$_n$H$_m$ molecules are more affected by
disequilibrium processes. The CO abundance, however, is affected
only marginally. While dayside abundances also notably change,
those around the evening terminator of HAT-P-7b are the least
affected by disequilibrium processes. The latter finding may
partially explain the consistency of observed transmission
spectra of UHJs with atmospheres in thermochemical equilibrium.
Photochemistry only negligibly affects molecular abundances and
quenching levels. \ Conclusions: In general, the
quenching points of the atmosphere of HAT-P-7b are at much lower
pressures than in the cooler hot-jupiters. We propose several
avenues to determining the effect of disequilibrium processes on
UHJs that are in general based on abundance and opacity
measurements at different local times. It remains a challenge to
completely disentangle this from the chemical effects of clouds
and that of a primordial nonsolar abundance.},
