 abstract = {The list of planets discovered in the habitable zone of its star is
continuously growing. We present a simple one-dimension
radiative transfer model in order to better infer on the
habitability of such systems. Particular focus is on the
TRAPPIST-1 planets (Gillon et al. 2017), particularly on planets
b, c, d, e and f.},
