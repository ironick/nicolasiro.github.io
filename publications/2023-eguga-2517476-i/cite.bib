 abstract = {M-dwarf stars have been preferred targets of exoplanet search due to the
favourable parameters of the system for remote characterisation.
However, planets in the habitable zones of these stars are
expecting to experience intense radiation. We present the
INCREASE project (INfluence of strong stellar particle Events
and galactic Cosmic Rays on Exoplanetary AtmoSpherEs), aiming at
modelling the effect of energetic particles on the atmosphere of
terrestrial exoplanets. The INCREASE model suite is an almost
self-consistent simulation chain coupling the state-of-the-art
magnetospheric and atmospheric propagation and interaction
models PLANETOCOSMICS (Desorgher et al. 2006) and AtRIS
(Banjac57 et al. 2019) with the atmospheric chemistry and
climate models 1D-TERRA (e.g., Wunderlich et al. 2020) and
ExoTIC. Finally, spectral characterisation is done using the
GARLIC line by line radiative transfer model. By combining these
models, we are able to constrain the habitability of such
planets, the stability of their atmosphere as well as simulating
observational features.},
