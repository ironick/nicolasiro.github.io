 abstract = {Measuring the abundances of carbon and oxygen in exoplanet atmospheres
is considered a crucial avenue for unlocking the formation and
evolution of exoplanetary systems$^1,2$. Access to the
chemical inventory of an exoplanet requires high-precision
observations, often inferred from individual molecular
detections with low-resolution space-based$^3-5$ and high-
resolution ground-based$^6-8$ facilities. Here we report the
medium-resolution (R \ensuremath≈ 600) transmission
spectrum of an exoplanet atmosphere between 3 and 5
\ensuremathμm covering several absorption features for the
Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b (ref. $^9$), obtained with the
Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) G395H grating of JWST. Our
observations achieve 1.46 times photon precision, providing an
average transit depth uncertainty of 221 ppm per spectroscopic
bin, and present minimal impacts from systematic effects. We
detect significant absorption from CO$_2$
(28.5\ensuremathσ) and H$_2$O
(21.5\ensuremathσ), and identify SO$_2$ as the source
of absorption at 4.1 \ensuremathμm
(4.8\ensuremathσ). Best-fit atmospheric models range
between 3 and 10 times solar metallicity, with sub-solar to
solar C/O ratios. These results, including the detection of
SO$_2$, underscore the importance of characterizing the
chemistry in exoplanet atmospheres and showcase NIRSpec G395H as
an excellent mode for time-series observations over this
critical wavelength range$^10$.},
