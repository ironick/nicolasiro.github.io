 abstract = {Close-in giant exoplanets with temperatures greater than 2,000 K
(`ultra-hot Jupiters') have been the subject of extensive
efforts to determine their atmospheric properties using thermal
emission measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and
Spitzer Space Telescope$^1-3$. However, previous studies have
yielded inconsistent results because the small sizes of the
spectral features and the limited information content of the
data resulted in high sensitivity to the varying assumptions
made in the treatment of instrument systematics and the
atmospheric retrieval analysis$^3-12$. Here we present a
dayside thermal emission spectrum of the ultra-hot Jupiter
WASP-18b obtained with the NIRISS$^13$ instrument on the JWST.
The data span 0.85 to 2.85 \ensuremathμm in wavelength at
an average resolving power of 400 and exhibit minimal
systematics. The spectrum shows three water emission features
(at >6\ensuremathσ confidence) and evidence for optical
opacity, possibly attributable to H$^\ensuremath-$, TiO
and VO (combined significance of 3.8\ensuremathσ).
Models that fit the data require a thermal inversion, molecular
dissociation as predicted by chemical equilibrium, a solar
heavy-element abundance (`metallicity', M/H =1.0
3$_\ensuremath-0.51$$^+1.11$ times solar) and a carbon-
to-oxygen (C/O) ratio less than unity. The data also yield a
dayside brightness temperature map, which shows a peak in
temperature near the substellar point that decreases steeply and
symmetrically with longitude towards the terminators.},
