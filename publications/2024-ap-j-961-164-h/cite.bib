 abstract = {Ongoing observing projects like the James Webb Space Telescope and
future missions offer the chance to characterize Earth-like
exoplanetary atmospheres. Thereby, M dwarfs are preferred
targets for transit observations, for example, due to their
favorable planet–star contrast ratio. However, the
radiation and particle environment of these cool stars could be
far more extreme than what we know from the Sun. Thus, knowing
the stellar radiation and particle environment and its possible
influence on detectable biosignatures—in particular,
signs of life like ozone and methane—is crucial to
understanding upcoming transit spectra. In this study, with the
help of our unique model suite INCREASE, we investigate the
impact of a strong stellar energetic particle event on the
atmospheric ionization, neutral and ion chemistry, and
atmospheric biosignatures of TRAPPIST-1e. Therefore, transit
spectra for six scenarios are simulated. We find that a
Carrington-like event drastically increases atmospheric
ionization and induces substantial changes in ion chemistry and
spectral transmission features: all scenarios show high event-
induced amounts of nitrogen dioxide (i.e., at 6.2
\ensuremathμm), a reduction of the atmospheric transit
depth in all water bands (i.e., at 5.5–7.0
\ensuremathμm), a decrease of the methane bands (i.e., at
3.0–3.5 \ensuremathμm), and depletion of ozone
(i.e., at \ensuremath∼9.6 \ensuremathμm).
Therefore, it is essential to include high-energy particle
effects to correctly assign biosignature signals from, e.g.,
ozone and methane. We further show that the nitric acid feature
at 11.0–12.0 \ensuremathμm, discussed as a
proxy for stellar particle contamination, is absent in wet-dead
atmospheres.},
