 abstract = {The exoplanet community possesses an incredible variety of models to
match the astronomical diversity of exoplanets. Those models are
used to either predict or interpret exoplanet data. However,
contrary to Earth science, we have no existing ground truth to
validate those models. Meanwhile, we would still learn a lot
from benchmarking exoplanet models together to increase the
robustness in our data prediction and interpretation, to
identify bugs and to highlight model features that would require
additional developments.The Climates Using Interactive Suites of
Intercomparisons Nested for Exoplanet Studies (CUISINES) Working
Group of NASA's Nexus for Exoplanet Systems Science (NExSS)
supports a systematized approach to evaluating the performance
of exoplanet models, and provides here a framework for
conducting community-organized exoplanet Model Intercomparison
Projects (exoMIPs). The CUISINES framework adapts Earth climate
community practices specifically for the needs of the exoplanet
researchers, encompassing a range of model types, planetary
targets, and parameter space studies. In this presentation, we
will give updates on the various exoMIPs and we will provide
insights on our findings to make an exoplanet model
intercomparison a success on short and long timescales.},
