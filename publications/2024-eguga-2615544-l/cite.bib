 abstract = {The atmospheric characterization of a significant number of terrestrial
exoplanets is a major goal of 21st century astrophysics.
However, none of the currently adopted missions worldwide has
the technical capabilities to achieve this goal. Here we present
the LIFE mission concept, which addresses this issue by
investigating the scientific potential and technological
challenges of an ambitious mission employing a formation-flying
nulling interferometer in space working at mid-infrared
wavelengths. LIFE, in synergy with other planned future
missions, will for the first time in human history enable us to
understanding global biosignatures and planetary habitability in
the context of the diversity of planetary systems. Breakthroughs
in our understanding of the exoplanet population and relevant
technologies justify the need, but also the feasibility, for
future atmosphere characterization and life detection missions
to investigate one of the most fundamental questions of
humankind: how frequent and diverse are global biospheres in the
galaxy?},
