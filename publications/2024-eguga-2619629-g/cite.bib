 abstract = {We present numerical studies of star/planet interactions, specifically
the effects of Stellar Energetic Particles (SEPs) on the
atmospheres of terrestrial (exo)planets. This work was performed
as part of the INCREASE project (INfluence of strong stellar
particle Events and galactic Cosmic Rays on Exoplanetary
AtmoSpherEs) funded by the German Research Council (DFG). We
have developed and applied a new Model Suite which couples
magnetospheric and atmospheric propagation and interaction
models PLANETOCOSMICS (Desorgher et al. 2006) and AtRIS (Banjac
et al. 2019) with the atmospheric chemistry and climate models
1D-TERRA (e.g., Wunderlich et al. 2020) and ExoTIC (Sinnhuber et
al., 2012). We are able to assess the influence of the stellar
activity on the planetary atmospheric structure, its chemical
composition, and infer spectroscopic observables as well as the
effects on biosignatures.},
