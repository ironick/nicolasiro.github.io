 abstract = {Hot Jupiters are among the best-studied exoplanets, but it is still
poorly understood how their chemical composition and cloud
properties vary with longitude. Theoretical models predict that
clouds may condense on the nightside and that molecular
abundances can be driven out of equilibrium by zonal winds. Here
we report a phase-resolved emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter
WASP-43b measured from 5 \ensuremathμm to 12
\ensuremathμm with the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument. The
spectra reveal a large day-night temperature contrast (with
average brightness temperatures of 1,524 \ensuremath± 35 K
and 863 \ensuremath± 23 K, respectively) and evidence for
water absorption at all orbital phases. Comparisons with three-
dimensional atmospheric models show that both the phase-curve
shape and emission spectra strongly suggest the presence of
nightside clouds that become optically thick to thermal emission
at pressures greater than åisebox-0.5ex~100
mbar. The dayside is consistent with a cloudless atmosphere
above the mid-infrared photosphere. Contrary to expectations
from equilibrium chemistry but consistent with disequilibrium
kinetics models, methane is not detected on the nightside
(2\ensuremathσ upper limit of 1-6 ppm, depending on
model assumptions). Our results provide strong evidence that the
atmosphere of WASP-43b is shaped by disequilibrium processes and
provide new insights into the properties of the planet's
nightside clouds. However, the remaining discrepancies between
our observations and our predictive atmospheric models emphasize
the importance of further exploring the effects of clouds and
disequilibrium chemistry in numerical models.},
