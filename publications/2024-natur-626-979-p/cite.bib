 abstract = {The recent inference of sulfur dioxide (SO$_2$) in the atmosphere of
the hot (approximately 1,100 K), Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b
from near-infrared JWST observations$^1-3$ suggests that
photochemistry is a key process in high-temperature exoplanet
atmospheres$^4$. This is because of the low (<1 ppb) abundance
of SO$_2$ under thermochemical equilibrium compared with that
produced from the photochemistry of H$_2$O and H$_2$S (1-10
ppm)$^4-9$. However, the SO$_2$ inference was made from a
single, small molecular feature in the transmission spectrum of
WASP-39b at 4.05 \ensuremathμm and, therefore, the
detection of other SO$_2$ absorption bands at different
wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO$_2$
abundance. Here we report the detection of SO$_2$ spectral
features at 7.7 and 8.5 \ensuremathμm in the
5-12-\ensuremathμm transmission spectrum of WASP-39b
measured by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low
Resolution Spectrometer (LRS)$^10$. Our observations suggest
an abundance of SO$_2$ of 0.5-25 ppm (1\ensuremathσ
range), consistent with previous findings$^4$. As well as
SO$_2$, we find broad water-vapour absorption features, as
well as an unexplained decrease in the transit depth at
wavelengths longer than 10 \ensuremathμm. Fitting the
spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward models, we derive an
atmospheric heavy-element content (metallicity) for WASP-39b of
approximately 7.1-8.0 times solar and demonstrate that
photochemistry shapes the spectra of WASP-39b across a broad
wavelength range.},
