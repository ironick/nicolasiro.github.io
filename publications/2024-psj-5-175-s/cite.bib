 abstract = {As JWST begins to return observations, it is more important than ever
that exoplanet climate models can consistently and correctly
predict the observability of exoplanets, retrieval of their
data, and interpretation of planetary environments from that
data. Model intercomparisons play a crucial role in this
context, especially now when few data are available to validate
model predictions. The CUISINES Working Group of NASA's Nexus
for Exoplanet Systems Science supports a systematic approach to
evaluating the performance of exoplanet models and provides here
a framework for conducting community-organized exoplanet model
intercomparison projects (exoMIPs). The CUISINES framework
adapts Earth climate community practices specifically for the
needs of the exoplanet researchers, encompassing a range of
model types, planetary targets, and parameter space studies. It
is intended to help researchers to work collectively, equitably,
and openly toward common goals. The CUISINES framework rests on
five principles: (1) define in advance what research question(s)
the exoMIP is intended to address, (2) create an experimental
design that maximizes community participation and advertise it
widely, (3) plan a project timeline that allows all exoMIP
members to participate fully, (4) generate data products from
model output for direct comparison to observations, and (5)
create a data management plan that is workable in the present
and scalable for the future. Within the first years of its
existence, CUISINES is already providing logistical support to
10 exoMIPs and will continue to host annual workshops for
further community feedback and presentation of new exoMIP ideas.},
