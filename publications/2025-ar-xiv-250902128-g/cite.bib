 abstract = {We report JWST/MIRI 15 $μ$m phase curves of TRAPPIST-1 b and c,
revealing thermal emission consistent with their irradiation
levels, assuming no efficient heat redistribution. We find that
TRAPPIST-1 b shows a high dayside brightness temperature (490
$±$ 17 K), no significantly detectable nightside emission
($F_m̊ b, Night, max$ = $39_-27^+55$ ppm), and no phase
offset -- features consistent with a low-albedo, airless
ultramafic rocky surface. TRAPPIST-1 c exhibits a lower dayside
brightness temperature (369 $±$ 23 K), and a nightside flux
statistically indistinguishable from that of TRAPPIST-1 b
($F_\ ̊c, Night, max$ = $62_-43^+60$ ppm). Atmosphere
models with surface pressures $≥$1 bar and efficient
greenhouse effects are strongly disfavoured for both planets.
TRAPPIST-1 b is unlikely to possess any substantial atmosphere,
while TRAPPIST-1 c may retain a tenuous, greenhouse-poor
O$_2$-dominated atmosphere or be similarly airless with a more
reflective surface. These results suggest divergent evolutionary
pathways or atmospheric loss processes, despite similar
compositions. These measurements tightly constrain atmosphere
retention in the inner TRAPPIST-1 system.},
