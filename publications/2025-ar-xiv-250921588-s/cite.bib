 abstract = {With JWST, observing separate spectra of the morning and evening limbs
of hot Jupiters has finally become a reality. The first such
observation was reported for WASP-39b, where the evening
terminator was observed to have a larger transit radius by about
400 ppm and a stronger 4.3 $μ$m CO$_2$ feature than the morning
terminator. Multiple factors, including temperature differences,
photo/thermochemistry, clouds and hazes, could cause such limb
asymmetries. To interpret these new limb asymmetry observations,
a detailed understanding of how the relevant processes affect
morning and evening spectra grounded in forward models is
needed. Focusing on WASP-39b, we compare simulations from five
different general circulation models (GCMs), including one
simulating disequilibrium thermochemistry and one with cloud
radiative feedback, to the recent WASP-39b limb asymmetry
observations. We also post-process the temperature structures of
all simulations with a 2D photochemical model and one simulation
with a cloud microphysics model. Although the temperatures
predicted by the different models vary considerably, the models
are remarkably consistent in their predicted morning--evening
temperature differences. Several equilibrium-chemistry
simulations predict strong methane features in the morning
spectrum, not seen in the observations. When including
disequilibrium processes, horizontal transport homogenizes
methane, and these methane features disappear. However, even
after including photochemistry and clouds, our models still
cannot reproduce the observed $∼2000$ ppm asymmetry in the
CO$_2$ feature. A combination of factors, such as varying
metallicity and unexplored parameters in cloud models, may
explain the discrepancy, emphasizing the need for future models
integrating cloud microphysics and feedback across a broader
parameter space.},
