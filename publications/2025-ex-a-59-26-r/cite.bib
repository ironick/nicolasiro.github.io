 abstract = {PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) is ESA's M3 mission
designed to detect and characterise extrasolar planets and
perform asteroseismic monitoring of a large number of stars.
PLATO will detect small planets (down to <2REarth) around bright
stars (<11 mag), including terrestrial planets in the habitable
zone of solar-like stars. With the complement of radial velocity
observations from the ground, planets will be characterised for
their radius, mass, and age with high accuracy (5%, 10%, 10%
for an Earth-Sun combination respectively). PLATO will provide
us with a large-scale catalogue of well-characterised small
planets up to intermediate orbital periods, relevant for a
meaningful comparison to planet formation theories and to better
understand planet evolution. It will make possible comparative
exoplanetology to place our Solar System planets in a broader
context. In parallel, PLATO will study (host) stars using
asteroseismology, allowing us to determine the stellar
properties with high accuracy, substantially enhancing our
knowledge of stellar structure and evolution. The payload
instrument consists of 26 cameras with 12cm aperture each. For
at least four years, the mission will perform high-precision
photometric measurements. Here we review the science objectives,
present PLATO's target samples and fields, provide an overview
of expected core science performance as well as a description of
the instrument and the mission profile towards the end of the
serial production of the flight cameras. PLATO is scheduled for
a launch date end 2026. This overview therefore provides a
summary of the mission to the community in preparation of the
upcoming operational phases.},
