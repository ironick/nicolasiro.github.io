designed to detect and characterise extrasolar planets and perform asteroseismic
monitoring of a large number of stars. PLATO will detect small planets (down to
&amp;lt;2REarth) around bright stars (&amp;lt;11 mag), including terrestrial planets in the habitable
zone of solar-like stars. With the complement of radial velocity observations from
the ground, planets will be characterised for their radius, mass, and age with high
accuracy (5%, 10%, 10% for an Earth-Sun combination respectively). PLATO will provide
us with a large-scale catalogue of well-characterised small planets up to intermediate
orbital periods, relevant for a meaningful comparison to planet formation theories
and to better understand planet evolution. It will make possible comparative exoplanetology
to place our Solar System planets in a broader context. In parallel, PLATO will
study (host) stars using asteroseismology, allowing us to determine the stellar
properties with high accuracy, substantially enhancing our knowledge of stellar
structure and evolution. The payload instrument consists of 26 cameras with 12cm
aperture each. For at least four years, the mission will perform high-precision
photometric measurements. Here we review the science objectives, present PLATO&amp;rsquo;s
target samples and fields, provide an overview of expected core science performance
as well as a description of the instrument and the mission profile towards the end
of the serial production of the flight cameras. PLATO is scheduled for a launch
date end 2026. This overview therefore provides a summary of the mission to the
community in preparation of the upcoming operational phases.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
