Ultra-hot Jupiters are the hottest exoplanets that have been discovered
so far. They present a unique possibility to explore hot and cold chemistry on
one object. The tidally locked ultra- hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b has a day-to-night
temperature difference of ≃2500 K, confining cloud formation to the nightside
and efficient ionisation to the dayside. Both have distinct observational signatures.
Aims: We analyse plasma and magnetic processes in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot
Jupiter HAT-P-7b to investigate the formation of an ionosphere and the possibility
of magnetically coupling the atmospheric gas as the base for an extended exosphere.
We show which ions and atoms may be used as spectral tracers, and if and where
conditions for lightning may occur within the clouds of HAT-P-7b. Methods: We
used 3D modelling results as input for a kinetic cloud formation code and evaluated
characteristic plasma and magnetic coupling parameters. A local thermodynamical
equilibrium radiative transfer was solved for the ionised gas phase. This study&lt;br>
is confined to thermal ionisation only. Results: The ionisation throughout HAT-P-7b&amp;rsquo;s
atmosphere varies drastically between day- and nightside. The dayside has high
levels of thermal ionisation and long-range electromagnetic interactions dominate
over kinetic electron-neutral interactions, suggesting a day-night difference
in magnetic coupling. K$^+$, Na$^+$, Li$^+$, Ca$^+$, and Al$^+$ are more abundant
than their atomic counterparts on the dayside. The minimum magnetic flux density
for electrons for magnetic coupling is B &amp;lt; 0.5 G for all regions of HAT-P-7b&amp;rsquo;s
atmosphere. Conclusions: HAT-P-7b&amp;rsquo;s dayside has an asymmetric ionosphere that
extends deep into the atmosphere, the nightside has no thermally driven ionosphere.
A corresponding asymmetry is imprinted in the ion and neutral composition at the
terminators. The ionosphere on HAT-P-7b may be directly traced by the Ca$^+$ H&amp;amp;K
lines if the local temperature is ensuremath≥5000 K. The whole atmosphere may
couple to a global, large-scale magnetic field, and lightning may occur on the
nightside.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding the atmospheric properties and chemical composition of the ultra-hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b. II. Mapping the effects of gas kinetics</title><link>https://ironick.github.io/publications/2020-aa-635-a-31-m.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ironick.github.io/publications/2020-aa-635-a-31-m.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Aims: The atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are commonly considered
to be at thermochemical equilibrium. We aim to provide disequilibrium chemistry
maps for a global understanding of the chemistry in the atmosphere of HAT-P-7b and
assess the importance of disequilibrium chemistry on UHJs. Methods: We applied
a hierarchical modeling approach using 97 1D atmospheric profiles from a 3D general
circulation model of HAT-P-7b. For each atmospheric 1D profile, we evaluated our
kinetic cloud formation model consistently with the local gas-phase composition
in chemical equilibrium. This served as input to study the quenching of dominating
CHNO- binding molecules. We evaluated quenching results from a zeroth- order approximation
in comparison to a kinetic gas-phase approach. Results: We find that the zeroth-order
approach of estimating quenching points agrees well with the full gas-kinetic modeling
results. However, it underestimates the quenching levels by about one order of magnitude
at high temperatures. Chemical disequilibrium has the greatest effect on the nightside
and morning abundance of species such as H, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, HCN, and all
C$_n$H$_m$ molecules; heavier C$_n$H$_m$ molecules are more affected by disequilibrium
processes. The CO abundance, however, is affected only marginally. While dayside
abundances also notably change, those around the evening terminator of HAT-P-7b
are the least affected by disequilibrium processes. The latter finding may partially
explain the consistency of observed transmission spectra of UHJs with atmospheres
in thermochemical equilibrium. Photochemistry only negligibly affects molecular
abundances and quenching levels. Conclusions: In general, the quenching points
of the atmosphere of HAT-P-7b are at much lower pressures than in the cooler hot-jupiters.
We propose several avenues to determining the effect of disequilibrium processes
on UHJs that are in general based on abundance and opacity measurements at different
local times. It remains a challenge to completely disentangle this from the chemical
effects of clouds and that of a primordial nonsolar abundance.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
